is that branch of biology dealing with the identification and naming
of organisms. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle apparently
began the discussion on taxonomy. British naturalist John Ray is
credited with revising the concept of naming and describing
organisms. During the 1700s, Swedish botanist Carolus Linneus
classified all then-known organisms into two large groups: the
kingdoms Plantae and Animalia. Robert Whittaker in 1969 proposed five
kingdoms: Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, Protista, and Monera. Other
schemes involving an even greater number of kingdoms have lately been
proposed, however most biologists employ Whittaker's five kingdoms.
Recent studies suggest that three domains be employed: Archaea,
Bacteria, and Eukarya. The classification of a rose is shown in
Figure 1, while that of a warbler is illustrated in Figure 2.

groups</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. To build these trees, we must have
data, which comes from the characteristics used in classification.
There are several methods of classification: traditional, phentic,
and cladistic. They differ in how they value certain characters.
Let's consider how traditional classification treats reptiles, birds,
and mammals, as shown in Figure 3.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Traditional Classification</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Data used in traditional systematics stresses both
common ancestry (monophylesis) and the amount of divergence among
groups. The traditional, dating to Linneaus view, is that birds have
feathers, reptiles have scales, and mammals have hair. Using this as
a major character, a classification like that above has been
constructed. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossF.html#fossil"><FONT SIZE="+1">Fossils</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
evidence of past life, are not included in this classification. Since
all of these groups have the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#amniote egg"><FONT SIZE="+1">amniotic
egg</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, or a modification of it, they would
be united in a larger taxon. Linneus placed each of these groups in a
separate class within the Phylum Chordata. A primitive character is
one present in the common ancestor and all members of the group, such
as the amniotic egg. A derived character is one found only in a
particular lineage within the larger group. In our example above,
hair and feathers may be viewed as derived characters. A traditional
view of our example group is that birds and mammals evolved from
reptiles due to their unique derived characters. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Cladistics and Cladograms</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Cladistics is a type of systematics developed by
the late German biologist Willi Hennig, who attempted to formulate a
more objective method of classifying organisms. Cladists group
organisms based on the presence of shared derived characters, not the
overall similarity of potential group members. In the example cited
in Figure 3, the amniotic egg would be used to unite a group sharing
common ancestry, since it would NOT be present in a group that was
not in the lineage. The use of feathers and hair to separate birds
and mammals from reptiles would NOT factor into a cladistic
hypothesis, or cladogram, since these are characters unique to only
one taxon in our group. Such an approach is shown in Figure 4.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The value of cladistics lies in its capacity to
generate (and provide a set of criteria for the evaluation) of
multiple hypotheses (alternate cladograms) that can be evaluated with
additional data. Almost always the "correct" cladogram employs the
principle of parsimony, which proposes that the shortest number of
steps or character state changes is most likely correct. An important
question....is evolution always parsimonmious? However the ultimate
answer to that question unfolds, the rigor cladistics introduces to
systematics is useful in getting traditional systematists to look at
their subjective classifications in a new light. On the diagram shown
in Figure 5, shared derived characters are indicated as hauchers
across the lines. The mammal clade (in this case represented by mouse
and chimpanzee) is united by fur, the lizard, pigeon, mouse-chimp
clade is united by claws or nails, etc. </FONT></P>

would produce a very different classification! Note that crocodiles
have more in common (in a cladistic sense) with birds than they do
with other reptiles. Birds and crocs form a clade, or monophyletic
group united by shared derived characters not present in the other
groups. If we construct a Linnean group from this cladogram, we have
a class of birds and crocodiles, a second class of lizards, snakes,
and turtles, and a third class of mammals, as shown in Figure 6.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">One of the more interesting applications of
cladistics is to the question of the pandas. The giant panda was once
thought to be a bear, but later its racoon-like characters caused it
to be placed closer to racoons. The red (lesser) panda lives in the
same areas of China as the giant panda, but has a far greater
similarity with racoons, as shown in Figure 7. DNA hybridization
studies suggest the giant panda is in the bear clade, while the red
panda is in the racoon clade. Both share a common ancestry, as
indicated by shared derived characters, followed by convergent
evolution of other characters. The diagram above indicates this
divergence from common ancestry, and even attempts to show the time
of that divergence. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Phenetics</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Phenetics is a process by which taxa are clustered
together based on the number of their similarities (or differences,
depending on the numerical coefficient employed). Traits are measured
and either converted into integers or input directly as numerical
data. Theses data are then mathematically processed using an
algorithm that generates a similarity (or distance as the case may
be) matrix. Various graphical representations of this matrix include
a phenogram, and principal coordinate plot. Phenetic classifications
are plagued by problems of convergence and parallelism, but are
useful in their attempt to objectify the classification process. My
previous work on triprojectate pollen employed phenetics to deal with
a wide array of subjective ratios or other classification methods.
Convergence was a given with this group of fossil pollen produced by
one or more groups of unknown extinct plants. Since monophylesis
could not be established for the entire group, phenetics was use to
help delineate possible monophyletic groups for eventual cladistic
study. </FONT></P>
