<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ecologists find that within a community many
populations are <B>not</B> randomly distributed. This recognition
that there was a pattern and process of spatial distribution of
species was a major accomplishment of ecology. Two of the most
important patterns are </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#open community"><FONT SIZE="+1">open
community</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> structure and the relative
rarity of species within a community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Do species within a community have similar
geographic range and density peaks? If they do, the community is said
to be a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#closed community"><FONT SIZE="+1">closed
community</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, a discrete unit with sharp
boundaries known as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#ecotones"><FONT SIZE="+1">ecotones</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
An open community, however, has its populations without ecotones and
distributed more or less randomly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In a forest, where we find an open community
structure, there is a gradient of soil moisture. Plants have
different tolerances to this gradient and occur at different places
along the continuum. Where the physical environment has abrupt
transitions, we find sharp boundaries developing between populations.
For example, an ecotone develops at a beach separating water and
land. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Open structure provides some protection for the
community. Lacking boundaries, it is harder for a community to be
destroyed in an all or nothing fashion. Species can come and go
within communities over time, yet the community as a whole persists.
In general, communities are less fragile and more flexible than some
earlier concepts would suggest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most species in a community are far less abundant
than the dominant species that provide a community its name: for
example oak-hickory, pine, etc. Populations of just a few species are
dominant within a community, no matter what community we examine.

biomes occupy the most extreme environments, with little or no
moisture and extremes of temperature acting as harsh selective agents
on organisms that occupy these areas. These two biomes have the
fewest numbers of species due to the stringent environmental
conditions. In other words, not everyone can live there due to the
specialized adaptations required by the environment.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Tropical Rain Forests</FONT></H4>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#tropical rain forest biome"><FONT SIZE="+1">Tropical
rain forests</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> occur in regions near the
equator. The climate is always warm (between 20&#176; and 25&#176; C)
with plenty of rainfall (at least 190 cm/year). The rain forest is
probably the richest biome, both in diversity and in total biomass.
The tropical rain forest has a complex structure, with many levels of
life. More than half of all terrestrial species live in this biome.
While diversity is high, dominance by a particular species is low.
Typical tropical rain forest views are shown in Figure 2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">While some animals live on the ground, most rain
forest animals live in the trees. Many of these animals spend their
entire life in the forest canopy. Insects are so abundant in tropical
rain forests that the majority have not yet been identified. Charles
Darwin noted the number of species found on a single tree, and
suggested the richness of the rain forest would stagger the future
systematist with the size of the catalogue of animal species found
there. Termites are critical in the decomposition and nutrient
cycling of wood. Birds tend to be brightly colored, often making them
sought after as exotic pets. Amphibians and reptiles are well
represented. Lemurs, sloths, and monkeys feed on fruits in tropical
rain forest trees. The largest carnivores are the cats (jaguars in
South America and leopards in Africa and Asia). Encroachment and
destruction of habitat put all these animals and plants at risk.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants.
These epiphytes have their own roots to absorb moisture and minerals,
and use the other plant more as an aid to grow taller. Some tropical
forests in India, Southeast Asia, West Africa, Central and South
American are seasonal and have trees that shed leaves in dry season.
The warm, moist climate supports high productivity as well as rapid
decomposition of detritus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">With its yearlong growing season, tropical forests
have a rapid cycling of nutrients. Soils in tropical rain forests
tend to have very little organic matter since most of the organic
carbon is tied up in the standing </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#biomass"><FONT SIZE="+1">biomass</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
of the plants. These tropical soils, termed laterites, make poor
agricultural soils after the forest has been cleared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">About 17 million hectares of rain forest are
destroyed each year (an area equal in size to Washington state).
Estimates indicate the forests will be destroyed (along with a great
part of the Earth's diversity) within 100 years. Rainfall and climate
patterns could change as a result.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The shrubland biome is dominated by shrubs with
small but thick evergreen leaves that are often coated with a thick,
waxy cuticle, and with thick underground stems that survive the dry
summers and frequent fires. Shrublands occur in parts of South
America, western Australia, central Chile, and around the
Mediterranean Sea. Dense shrubland in California, where the summers
are hot and very dry, is known as chaparral, shown in Figure 4. This
Mediterranean-type shrubland lacks an understory and ground litter,
and is also highly flammable. The seeds of many species require the
heat and scarring action of fire to induce germination.</FONT></P>

inches per year) or prolonged dry seasons. Grasslands occur in the
Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Soils in this region are deep

entirely devoid of trees, and can support large herds of grazing
animals. Natural grasslands once covered over 40 percent of the
earth's land surface. In temperate areas where rainfall is between 10

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Temperate grasslands include the Russian steppes,
the South American pampas, and North American prairies. A tall-grass
prairie occurs where moisture is not quite sufficient to support

moisture and occurs between a tall-grass prairie and desert. A desert
grassland is shown in Figure 6. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Deserts are characterized by dry conditions
(usually less than 10 inches per year; 25 cm) and a wide temperature

freezing at night to over 120 degrees during the day. Most deserts
occur at latitudes of 30<SUP>o</SUP> N or S</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">where descending air masses are dry. Some deserts
occur in the rainshadow of tall mountain ranges or in coastal areas
near cold offshore currents. Plants in this biome have developed a
series of adaptations (such as succulent stems, and small, spiny, or
absent leaves) to conserve water and deal with these temperature
extremes. Photosynthetic modifications (CAM) are another strategy to
life in the drylands. </FONT></P>

mountain tops; and the temperate rain forest along the Pacific Coast
as far south as California. The taiga receives between 10 and 40
inches of rain per year and has a short growing season. Winters are
cold and short, while summers tend to be cool. The taiga is noted for
its great stands of spruce, fir, hemlock, and pine. These trees have
thick protective leaves and bark, as well as needlelike (evergreen)
leaves can withstand the weight of accumulated snow. Taiga forests
have a limited understory of plants, and a forest floor covered by
low-lying mosses and lichens. Conifers, alders, birch and willow are
common plants; wolves, grizzly bears, moose, and caribou are common
animals. Dominance of a few species is pronounced, but diversity is

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The tundra, shown in Figure 9, covers the
northernmost regions of North America and Eurasia, about 20% of the
Earth's land area. This biome receives about 20 cm (8-10 inches) of
rainfall annually. Snow melt makes water plentiful during summer
months. Winters are long and dark, followed by very short summers.
Water is frozen most of the time, producing frozen soil, permafrost.
Vegetation includes no trees, but rather patches of grass and shrubs;
grazing musk ox, reindeer, and caribou exist along with wolves, lynx,
and rodents. A few animals highly adapted to cold live in the tundra
year-round (lemming, ptarmigan). During the summer the tundra hosts
numerous insects and migratory animals. The ground is nearly
completely covered with sedges and short grasses during the short
summer. There are also plenty of patches of lichens and mosses. Dwarf
woody shrubs flower and produce seeds quickly during the short
growing season. The alpine tundra occurs above the timberline on
mountain ranges, and may contain many of the same plants as the
arctic tundra.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Deserts can occur in warm areas due to a blockage
of air circulation patterns that form a rain shadow, or from
atmospheric circulation patters as shown in Figure 11. Warm air
rises, producing low pressure areas. Cooler air sinks, producing high
pressure areas. The tropics tend to be atmospheric low pressure zones
the arctic areas atmospheric highs. Relative humidity is a measure of
how much water an air mass at a given temperature can hold. In short,
warm air can hold more moisture than can cold air. This basic
physical feature of air helps explain the distribution of some of the
world's great deserts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The warm, moist air masses in the tropics rise
upward in the atmosphere as they heat. The pressure of air rising
forces air in the upper atmosphere to flow away north and south. This
air at higher elevations is cooler and loses much of its moisture as
rainfall. When the air masses begin to descend they heat up and begin
to draw moisture from the lands they descend upon, at 30 degrees
north and south of the equator. Many of the world's deserts are at
approximately 30 degrees latitude, as shown in Figure 11..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Rain shadow deserts also form when cool, dry air
masses descend after passing over a tall mountain range, such as the
Coast Range and Sierras in California. The Sonoran desert in Arizona
(shown in Figure 7) is a doubly caused desert, being at 30 degrees
latitude as well as in the rain shadow of California mountains. The
Tian Shan desert in China is a typical rain shadow desert, as shown

because sunlight penetrates; nutrients are found here. Epipelagic
zone is brightly lit, has much photosynthetic phytoplankton, that
support zooplankton that are food for fish, squid, dolphins, and
whales. Mesopelagic zone is semi-dark and contains carnivores;
adapted organisms tend to be translucent, red colored, or
luminescent; for example: shrimps, squids, lantern and hatchet

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Freshwater Biome</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The freshwater biome is subdivided into two zones:
running waters and standing waters. Larger bodies of freshwater are
less prone to stratification (where oxygen decreases with depth). The
upper layers have abundant oxygen, the lowermost layers are
oxygen-poor. Mixing between upper and lower layers in a pond or lake
occurs during seasonal changes known as spring and fall
overturn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Lakes are larger than ponds, and are stratified in
summer and winter, as shown in Figure 16. The epilimnion is the upper
surface layer. It is warm in summer. The hypolimnion is the cold
lower layer. A sudden drop in temperature occurs at the middle of the
thermocline. Layering prevents mixing between the lower hypolimnion
(rich in nutrients) and the upper epilimnion (which has oxygen
absorbed from its surface). The epilimnion warms in spring and cools
in fall, causing a temporary mixing. As a consequence, phytoplankton
become more abundant due to the increased amounts of nutrients.

weight of living tissue) in a community.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Succession occurs because each community stage
prepares the environment for the stage following it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Primary succession begins with bare rock and takes
a very long time to occur. Weathering by wind and rain plus the
actions of pioneer species such as lichens and mosses begin the
buildup of soil. Herbaceous plants, including the grasses, grow on
deeper soil and shade out shorter pioneer species. Pine trees or
deciduous trees eventually take root and in most biomes will form a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#climax community"><FONT SIZE="+1">climax
community</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> of plants that are stabile in
the environment. The young produced by climax species can live in
that environment, unlike the young produced by successional species.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Secondary succession occurs when an environment
has been disturbed, such as by fire, geological activity, or human
intervention (farming or deforestation in most cases). This form of
succession often begins in an abandoned field with soil layers
already in place. Compared to primary succession, which must take
long periods of time to build or accumulate soil, secondary
succession occurs rapidly. The herbaceous pioneering plants give way
to pines, which in turn may give way to a hardwood deciduous forest
(in the classical old field succession models developed in the
eastern deciduous forest biome). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Early researchers assumed climax communities were
determined for each environment. Today we recognize the outcome of
competition among whatever species are present as establishing the
climax community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Climax communities tend to be more stable than
successional communities. Early stages of succession show the most
growth and are most productive. Pioneer communities lack diversity,
make poor use of inputs, and lose heat and nutrients. As succession
proceeds, species variety increases and nutrients are recycled more.
Climax communities make fuller use of inputs and maintain themselves,
thus, they are more stable. Human activity (such as clearing a climax
forest community to establish a farm field consisting of a cultivated
pioneering species, say corn or wheat) replaces climax communities
with simpler communities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Communities are composed of species that evolve,
so the community must also evolve.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Comparing
marine communities of 500 million years ago with modern communities
shows modern communities composed of quite different
organisms.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Modern communities also tend to be
more complex, although this may be a reflection of the nature of the
fossil record as well as differences between biological and fossil
species.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Disturbance of a Community</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The basic effect of human activity on communities
is </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#community simplification"><FONT SIZE="+1">community

Since herbivores take their food directly from the producer level, we

(or another type of consumer) and are secondary or tertiary
consumers. Omnivores, the feeding method used by humans, feed on both
plants and animals. Decomposers are organisms, mostly bacteria and

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Energy flow in ecosystems, as with all other
energy, must follow the two laws of thermodynamics. Recall that the
first law states that energy is neither created nor destroyed, but
instead changes from one form to another (potential to kinetic). The
second law mandates that when energy is transformed from one form to
another, some usable energy is lost as heat. Thus, in any food chain,
some energy must be lost as we move up the chain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The ultimate source of energy for nearly all life
is the Sun. Recently, scientists discovered an exception to this once
unchallenged truism: communities of organisms around ocean vents
where food chain begins with chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize
hydrogen sulfide generated by inorganic chemical reactions inside the
Earth's crust. In this special case, the source of energy is the
internal heat engine of the Earth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Food chains indicate who eats whom in an
ecosystem. Represent one path of energy flow through an ecosystem.
Natural ecosystems have numerous interconnected food chains. Each
level of producer and consumers is a trophic level. Some primary
consumers feed on plants and make grazing food chains; others feed on
detritus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The population size in an undisturbed ecosystem is
limited by the food supply, competition, predation, and parasitism.
Food webs help determine consequences of perturbations: if titmice
and vireos fed on beetles and earthworms, insecticides that killed
beetles</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">would increase competition between
birds and probably increase predation of earthworms, etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The trophic structure of an ecosystem forms an
ecological pyramid. The base of this pyramid represents the producer
trophic level. At the apex is the highest level consumer, the top
predator. Other pyramids can be recognized in an ecosystem. A pyramid
of numbers is based on how many organisms occupy each trophic level.
The pyramid of biomass is calculated by multiplying the average
weight for organisms times the number of organisms at each trophic
level. An energy pyramid illustrates the amounts of energy available
at each successive trophic level.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The energy
pyramid always shows a decrease moving up trophic levels because:
</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Only a certain amount of food is captured and
   eaten by organisms on the next trophic level. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Some of food that is eaten cannot be digested
   and exits digestive tract as undigested waste. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Only a portion of digested food becomes part
   of the organism's body; rest is used as source of energy.
   </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Substantial portion of food energy goes to
   build up temporary ATP in mitochondria that is then used to
   synthesize</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">proteins, lipids, carbohydrates,
   fuel contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and other
   functions. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Only about 10% of the energy available at a
   particular trophic level is incorporated into tissues at the next
   level. Thus, a larger population can</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">be
   sustained by eating grain than by eating grain-fed animals since
   100 kg of grain would result in 10 human kg but if fed to cattle,
   the result, by the time that reaches the human is a paltry</FONT>

on the one preceding it.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">There are two types
