<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Energy releasing processes, ones that "generate"
energy, are termed exergonic reactions. Reactions that require energy
to initiate the reaction are known as endergonic reactions. All
natural processes tend to proceed in such a direction that the
disorder or randomness of the universe increases (the

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Biochemical reactions in living organisms are
essentially energy transfers. Often they occur together, "linked", in
what are referred to as oxidation/reduction reactions.

is the gain of an electron. Sometimes we also have H ions along for
the ride, so reduction also becomes the gain of H. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#oxidation"><FONT SIZE="+1">Oxidation</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is the loss of an electron (or hydrogen). In oxidation/reduction
reactions, one chemical is oxidized, and its electrons are passed
(like a hot potato) to another (reduced, then) chemical. Such coupled
reactions are referred to as redox reactions. The metabolic processes

constraints of a living system. Enzymes function as organic
catalysts. A catalyst is a chemical involved in, but not changed by,
a chemical reaction. Many enzymes function by lowering the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#energy of activation"><FONT SIZE="+1">activation
energy</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> of reactions. By bringing the
reactants closer together, chemical bonds may be weakened and
reactions will proceed faster than without the catalyst.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Enzymes can act rapidly, as in the case of
carbonic anhydrase (enzymes typically end in the -ase suffix), which
causes the chemicals to react 107 times faster than without the
enzyme present. Carbonic anhydrase speeds up the transfer of carbon
dioxide from cells to the blood. There are over 2000 known enzymes,
each of which is involved with one specific chemical reaction.
Enzymes are substrate specific. The enzyme peptidase (which breaks
peptide bonds in proteins) will not work on starch (which is broken
down by human-produced amylase in the mouth).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Enzymes are proteins. The functioning of the
enzyme is determined by the shape of the protein. The arrangement of
molecules on the enzyme produces an area known as the active site
within which the specific substrate(s) will "fit". It recognizes,
confines and orients the substrate in a particular direction.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The induced fit hypothesis suggests that the
binding of the substrate to the enzyme alters the structure of the
enzyme, placing some strain on the substrate and further facilitating
the reaction. Cofactors are nonproteins essential for enzyme
activity. Ions such as K<SUP>+</SUP> and Ca<SUP>+2</SUP> are
cofactors. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#coenzymes"><FONT SIZE="+1">Coenzymes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Enzymatic pathways form as a result of the common
occurrence of a series of dependent chemical reactions. In one
example, the end product depends on the successful completion of five
reactions, each mediated by a specific enzyme. The enzymes in a
series can be located adjacent to each other (in an organelle or in
the membrane of an organelle), thus speeding the reaction process.
Also, intermediate products tend not to accumulate, making the
process more efficient. By removing intermediates (and by inference
end products) from the reactive pathway, equilibrium (the tendency of
reactions to reverse when concentrations of the products build up to
a certain level) effects are minimized, since equilibrium is not
attained, and so the reactions will proceed in the "preferred"
direction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Negative feedback and a metabolic pathway. The
production of the end product (G) in sufficient quantity to fill the
square feedback slot in the enzyme will turn off this pathway between

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Temperature</B>: Increases in temperature will
speed up the rate of nonenzyme mediated reactions, and so temperature
increase speeds up enzyme mediated reactions, but only to a point.
When heated too much, enzymes (since they are proteins dependent on
their shape) become denatured. When the temperature drops, the enzyme
regains its shape. Thermolabile enzymes, such as those responsible
for the color distribution in Siamese cats and color camouflage of
the Arctic fox, work better (or work at all) at lower
temperatures.</FONT></P>

mechanism.</FONT></P>

protects a cell from the hazards or damage the enzyme might
cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Changes in pH</B> will also denature the enzyme
by changing the shape of the enzyme. Enzymes are also adapted to
operate at a specific pH or pH range. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Allosteric Interactions</B> may allow an enzyme
to be temporarily inactivated. Binding of an allosteric effector
changes the shape of the enzyme, inactivating it while the effector
is still bound. Such a mechanism is commonly employed in feedback
inhibition. Often one of the products, either an end or near-end
product act as an allosteric effector, blocking or shunting the
pathway. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Competitive Inhibition</B> works by the
competition of the regulatory compound and substrate for the binding
site. If enough regulatory compound molecules bind to enough enzymes,
the pathway is shut down or at least slowed down. PABA, a chemical
essential to a bacteria that infects animals, resembles a drug,
sulfanilamide, that competes with PABA, shutting down an essential
bacterial (but not animal) pathway. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Noncompetitive Inhibition</B> occurs when the
inhibitory chemical, which does not have to resemble the substrate,
binds to the enzyme other than at the active site. Lead binds to SH
groups in this fashion. Irreversible Inhibition occurs when the
chemical either permanently binds to or massively denatures the
enzyme so that the tertiary structure cannot be restored. Nerve gas
permanently blocks pathways involved in nerve message transmission,
resulting in death. Penicillin, the first of the "wonder drug"
antibiotics, permanently blocks the pathways certain bacteria use to
assemble their cell wall components.</FONT></P>
