<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Fission, budding, fragmentation, and the formation
of rhizomes and stolons are some of the mechanisms that allow
organisms to reproduce asexually. The hydra produces buds; starfish
can regenerate an entire body from a fragment of the original body.
Asexual reproduction allows an organism to rapidly produce many
offspring without the time and resources committed to courtship,
finding a mate, and mating. The lack of genetic variability in
asexually reproducing populations can be detrimental when
environmental conditions (for which all the clones are so well
adapted) change quickly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Menstrual cycles vary from between 15 and 31 days.
The first day of the cycle is the first day of blood flow (day 0)
known as menstruation. During menstruation the uterine lining is
broken down and shed as menstrual flow. FSH and LH are secreted on
day 0, beginning both the menstrual cycle and the ovarian cycle. Both
FSH and LH stimulate the maturation of a single follicle in one of
the ovaries and the secretion of estrogen. Rising levels of estrogen
in the blood trigger secretion of LH, which stimulates follicle
maturation and ovulation (day 14, or midcycle). LH stimulates the
remaining follicle cells to form the corpus luteum, which produces
both estrogen and progesterone. Click </FONT><A HREF="http://www.clc.uc.edu/~ladybug/bio105/menses01.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the
development of the endometrium and preparation of the uterine inner
lining for implantation of a zygote. If pregnancy does not occur, the
drop in FSH and LH cause the corpus luteum to disintegrate. The drop
in hormones also causes the sloughing off of the inner lining of the
uterus by a series of muscle contractions of the uterus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During male arousal, blood flows into the three
shafts of spongy erectile tissue inside the penis, causing it to

pelvic thrusts by both partners stimulate sensory receptors in the
penis, vaginal walls, and clitoris. The sperm leave the epididymis

pleasurable sensations. </FONT></P>

The decreasing size of cells increases their surface to volume ratio,
allowing for more efficient oxygen exchange between cells and their
environment. RNA and information carrying molecules are distributed
to various parts of the blastula, and this molecular differentiation
sets the stage for the layering of the body in the next phases of
development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Blastulation and gastrulation establish the main
body axis. Organ formation occurs in the next stage of the
development of the embryo. During organ formation, cell division is
accomplished by migration and aggregation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Pattern formation is the result of cells "sensing"
their position in the embryo relative to other cells and to form
structures appropriate to that position. Gradients of informational
molecules within the embryo have been suggested to provide the
positional information to cells. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#homeobox genes"><FONT SIZE="+1">Homeobox
genes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> are pattern genes; they coordinate
with gradients of information molecules to establish the body plan

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Induction is the process in which one cell or
tissue type affects the developmental fate of another cell or tissue.
As a cell begins to form certain structures, certain genes are turned
on, others are turned off. Induction affects patterns of gene
expression through physical contact or chemical signals. Formation of
the vertebrate eye is a well known example. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Fertilization, the fusion of the sperm and egg,
usually occurs in the upper third of the oviduct. Thirty minutes
after ejaculation, sperm are present in the oviduct, having traveled
from the vagina through the uterus and into the oviduct. Sperm
traverse this distance by the beating of their flagellum. Of the
several hundred million sperm released in the ejaculation, only a few
thousand reach the egg. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Only one sperm will fertilize the egg. One sperm
fuses with receptors on the surface of the secondary oocyte,
triggering a series of chemical changes in the outer oocyte membrane
that prevent any other sperm from entering the oocyte. The entry of
the sperm initiates Meiosis II in the oocyte. Fusion of the egg and
sperm nuclei forms the diploid zygote.</FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Stages</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The period of time from fertilization to birth
(usually 9 months) is divided into trimesters, each about three
months long. During pregnancy the zygote undergoes 40 to 44 rounds of
mitosis, producing an infant containing trillions of specialized
cells organized into tissues and organs. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The First Trimester</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The three embryonic tissue layers form. Cellular
differentiation begins to form organs during the third week. After
one month the embryo is 5 mm long and composed mostly of paired
somite segments. During the second month most of the major organ
systems form, limb buds develop. The embryo becomes a fetus by the
seventh week. Beginning the eighth week, the sexually neutral fetus
activates gene pathways for sex determination, forming testes in XY
fetuses and ovaries in XX fetuses. External genitalia develop.
</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Second Trimester</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The fetus increases in size during this trimester,
and bony parts of the skeleton begin to form. Fetal movements can be
felt by the mother.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Last Trimester</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During this trimester the fetus increases in size.
Circulatory and respiratory systems mature in preparation for air
breathing. Fetal growth during this time uses large parts of its
mother's protein and calcium intake. Maternal antibodies pass to the
fetus during the last month, conferring temporary
immunity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Birth is a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#positive feedback"><FONT SIZE="+1">positive

the cervix dilates to allow passage of the fetus. Uterine
contractions propel the fetus through the birth canal, usually head

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Second Stage</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Strong uterine contractions of a minute in
duration separated by two to three minute intervals propel the fetus
down the birth canal. Abdominal muscles relax in synchrony with the
uterine contractions. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Third Stage</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">After delivery of the baby, the umbilical cord is
clipped and cut. The placenta (or afterbirth) in expelled through the
vagina.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Milk Production</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Nursing mothers have their hormone levels and
uterine size return to normal much faster than non-nursing mothers.
Breasts develop the capability for milk secretion about the mid point
of pregnancy. Secretion of milk does not occur until delivery, and
the action of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#prolactin"><FONT SIZE="+1">prolactin</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Suckling by the infant causes production of oxytocin to promote

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The stages of life are noted by the acquisition of
social, physical, and mental skills. Other signs of maturation
include tattoos, body piercing, motorcycles, and backward-turned
baseball caps. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Infancy and Childhood</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Infancy lasts from birth until age two. Infant
reflexes concern finding the nipple: suckling can occur minutes after
birth, and the rooting reflex is a tactile clue for the infant to
turn its head toward a touch. During the first year the infant passes
through a series of developmental stages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Childhood begins at two and lasts until puberty.
Physical growth is accompanied by increasing development of motor and
language skills. Play, make-believe, and increases in memory and
attention span also occur.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Adolescence and Adulthood</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Growth accelerates during puberty. Boys increase
in height by 3-5 inches per year, girls 2-4 inches. The heart doubles
in size, and hormones stimulate sexual maturity. Growth ends during
the end of adolescence, and aging starts during the late twenties.
Life expectancy (47 and 50 years for males and females in 1900; 74
and 81 in 1996) has increased.</FONT></P>
