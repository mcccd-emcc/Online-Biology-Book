This has led to what is popularly known as the Cambrian Explosion,
the sudden appearance of a stupendous array of animal life, much of
which is not closely related to modern forms. Despite extinctions at
various times, the Paleozoic is notable for the increasing
modernization of life. The late Paleozoic, the subject of this
chapter, saw the spread of plant life over the land surface and the
emergence and diversification of amphibians and their descendants the
reptiles as dominant animal life on land. Diversification of fish,
which began during the Silurian period continued unabated during the
Devonian Period. By the end of the Paleozoic, almost all major groups
of life, except the flowering plants and mammals, had developed. The
Paleozoic ended in the greatest </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#mass extinction"><FONT SIZE="+1">mass

investigated and scientific consensus of its cause is emerging.

production of spores in cones borne at the tips of stems, and spores
bearing elaters (devices to aid in spore dispersal). The fossil
members of this group are often encountered in coal deposits of
Carboniferous age in North America and Europe. The first sphenophytes

group of the trimerophytes.</FONT></P>

free-living bisexual gametophyte generation develops. There are
12,000 species of ferns today, although the fossil history of ferns

anatomical similarities suggest that ferns and sphenophytes may have
shared a common ancestor within the trimerophytes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The seed ferns, fancy name pteridosperms
(literally fern-seed), appeared during the late Devonian. One of the

vine-like plants that probably grew on other plants. This group
produced seeds in a cupule-like structure. </FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Animals</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Perhaps the earliest animals ashore were the
invertebrates, most likely groups of arthropods. The oldest known
terrestrial arthropod is a trigonotarbid from the Silurian.
Trigonotarbids superficially looked like spiders. The major groups of
terrestrial arthropods were present during the Devonian: chelicerates
including mites, spiders, and arachnids; and made the transition to
land life, and uniramians including flightless insects, centipedes
and millipedes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The earliest terrestrial vertebrate fossils are
from the late Devonian. These "stem tetrapods" as they are known,
were essentially fish out of water. The late Devonian lungfish had
two groups, the Dipnoi (which includes the living African,
Auistralian, and South American lungfishes) and the Crossopterygii,
whose sole living member is the coelacanth <I>Latimeria</I>.
Comparison of the skull, forelimb, and tooth structure of Devonian
crosspterygians such as <I>Eusthenopteron</I> with similar areas in a
more specialized tetrapod such as <I>Ichthyostega</I> supports
descent of amphibians from Devonian crossopterygians. However, some
molecular studies point to descent of the amphibians from the
lungfish, the Dipnoi. </FONT></P>

moving toward the formation (again) of a world supercontinent,

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Near the end of the Devonian another mass
extinction occurred. This one was more severe on marine creatures
than on the newly established terrestrial forms. The corals were
quite seriously decimated, and the return of extensive reef building
did not happen until the Triassic with the evolution of a new group
of reef-building corals, the scleractinians. Brachiopods, trilobites
and primitive fish groups either were diminished or completely
snuffed out by this extinction event. </FONT></P>

glaciation has been proposed as the cause of the Devonian extinction,

extinction. Rocks in parts of Gondwana suggest a glacial event. The
forms of marine life most affected by the extinction were the warm
water to tropical ones. Another hypothesis for this extinction is
that an asteroid impact caused a global cooling. There are several
impact sites known to be of the right potential age to have been
involved in this extinction. Neither hypothesis, glaciation or
impact, is unequivocally supported by the available data. </FONT></P>

widespread occurrence of coal deposits formed during this timespan in
Europe and North America. Coal is a sedimentary rock composed of
plant debris (and occasionally material from other creatues) that was
deposited in abog or swamp that had little biological activity at its
bottom. This led to preservation of the plant leaves, stems, pollen
and other structures, although with continued burial these structures
become much less distinct. Time and pressure combine with chemical
changes to turn the plant material into coal. Fluctuating sea-levels
during the Carboniferous contributed to the preservation of many coal
environments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At first glance it might appear that the only
evolutionary changes of note were occurring on the land during the
Permian. Part of this illusion results from the relative scarcity of
Permian-aged marine sediments as well as the tendency of
land-dwellers to view themselves as the pinacle of evolution.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Plant life of the Permian took on an increasingly
modern "look" with the rise of a number of gymnosperm (naked seeded)
plants during the late Carboniferous and their diversification during
the Permian. Indeed, the late Carboniferous "extinction" is almost
inapplicable to terrestrial plants. The arborescent lycopds of the
carboniferous coal swamps disappeared before the end of that period.
The Permian saw the spread of conifers and cycads, two groups that
would dominate the floras of the world until the Cretaceous period
with the rise of the flowering plants. The first conifers had small
leaves similar to those seen in the modern plant <I>Auracaria</I>,
the Norfolk Island pine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Paleobotany of the Permian is also marked by an
interesting group of seed ferns completely restricted to Gondwana,
the southern parts of Pangaea. This group, the glossopterids,
produced a distinctive leaf type (classified under the leaf-genus
<I>Glossopteris</I>) as well as a unique, striated, bisaccate pollen
type. <I>Glossopteris</I> and its associated plant organs have been
found all over the former parts of Gondwana, the present continents
of India, Australia, Africa, South America and Antarctica. Seeds of
Glossopteris have been studied with computer simulations and found
too large to have travelled tyhe thousands of miles of open ocean
between Africa and South America. When Alfred Wegener proposed his
continental drift hypothesis in 1912 he used fossil evidence like
<I>Glossopteris</I> and its distribution to argue for the former
exstence of a supoer continent he termed Pangaea. When the bodies of
the ill-fated British expedition to the South Pole led by Captain
Scott were found in Antarctica, leaf fossils belonging to
<I>Glossopteris</I> were in the tents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The amniote lineage (the first truly terrestrial
vertebrates that did not need to return to water to lay eggs),
especially the fossils, often are classified based on the number of
openings in the skulls. These openings allow for muscle attachment
and have traditionally been used to separate the "reptiles" into
several groups, including the anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids. The
anapsids, which include the turtles, lack any openings. Synapsids
include the mammals and their predecesssor and related groups the
pelycosaur (the non-mammalian synapsids). Diapsids, with two openings
on each side of their skulls, include the birds, dinosaurs, and most
of the traditional reptile groups. The synapsids used to be called
the mammal-like reptiles. Recent studies suggest that many animals in
this group were not so strongly reptilian (such as ectothermy) as the
obsolete term "mammal-like reptiles" implied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The amniotes that had appeared during the late
Carboniferous diversified from the protothyrid stock along two
lineages: one leading to the quadrupedal pelycosaurs (stem synapsids)
of the Carboniferous-Permian and then to the therapsids (advanced
synapsids) of the Permian-Triassic; and the other leading to the
bipedal thecodonts of the Permian-Triassic. <I>Dimetrodon,</I> shown
above, was a member of the pelycosaurs, or non-mammalian therapsids.
By the end of the Permian the therapsids had developed, a group
possibly characterized by some degree of endothermy
(warm-bloodedness). The early mammals of the Triassic period are
possibly an offshoot or descendant group of the therapsids.

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Permian World</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Permian is geologically marked by the final
assembly of Pangaea, glaciation in the souther extreme of Gondwana,
and the greatest mass extinction in Earth history that occurred at
the close of the Permian. The Permian world was marked by a nearly
pole-to-pole supercontinent, Pangaea, that was surrounded by
Panthalassa, the world sea. A small ocean, Tethys (today represented
by the Mediterranean Sea) was also present. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The end of the Permian, also the end of the
Paleozoic era, was marked by the greatest extinction of the
Phanerozoic eon. Despite its magnitude, the terminal Permian
extinction has not received the amount of publicity or research that
the more famous, but lesser, terminal Cretaceous extinction has.
During the Permian extinction event, whose causes remain
controversial, over 95% of marine species went extinct, while 70% of
terresdtrial taxonomic familes suffered the same fate. The fusulinid
foraminiferans went completely extinct, as did the trilobites.
Brachiopod genera declined from 60 to 10. The majority of extinctions
seem to have occurred at low paleolatitudes, possibly suggesting some
event involving the ocean. </FONT></P>

What floral changes occurred during the Permian occurred earlier in
the period, when the gradual drying out of the continent led to the
evolution and spread of better adapted "dry forms" such as
gymnosperms and seed ferns to replace the swamp trees of the
Carboniferous such as arborescent lycopods and sphenopsids. One major
plant group disappeared, the swamp gymnosperm <I>Cordaites</I>.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The cause (or causes) of the Permian extinction
remain in dispute. </FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">The Siberian Traps are a massive lava flow in
   eastern Asia that may have contributed to (or even caused) the
   Permian event by triggering a massive, sudden glaciation as well
   as other environmental consequences of volcanic eruptions. The
   period of greatest eruption in the traps coincides with the mass
   extinction. Ages of the lava flows suggest the traps formed over a
   one million year interval. The traps are near the city of Tura and
   also occur in Yakutsk, Noril'sk and Irkutsk, covering an area of
   slightly less than 2 million square kilometers (an area larger
   than Europe). The original volume of the traps is estimated at
   between 1 million and 4 million cubic km. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that marks
   the close of the Mesozoic era has been hypothesized as a result of
   a large meteor or comet strike. Evidence of a similar (and larger)
   impact at the close of the Permian is not strongly supported,
   although some indirect evidence suggests an impact did occur
   during the Permian, although possibly not at the time of the
   extinction crisis. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Climate change, possibly caused by glaciation
   and/or volcanic activity, has been associated with many mass
   extinctions. It seems likely that climate change is a consequence
   of the cause of extinction rather than the root cause itself.
   </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Formation of Pangaea has been invoked as a
   cause for the extinction. However, the formation of Pangaea had
   occurred well before the mass extinction. The mountain building
   and associated tectonism would also have been extremely long term
   in duration, possibly 10 million years according to some studies
   of the snowball garnets from Vermont. Pangaea's presence may have
   led to extreme environments with hotter interior areas of the
   continent and colder polar areas, possibly producing glaciation.
   </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">There is evidence of a sudden drop in sea
   level at the end of the Permian. This could be attributed to the
   sudden cooling of the climate that produced glaciers at the
   southern polar areas in Gondwana. Glacial tillites and other
   geological evidence of late Permian age occur in Australia,
   Siberia and in the North Sea are interpreted as proof of the
   existence of large continental glaciers at the close of the
   Permian. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Poisoning of the ocean has been suggested due
   to an apparent drop in carbon isotope data obtained from marine
   sediments formed at the time of the extinction. The cause of this
   apparent dropoff in the photosynthetic rate in the seas has not
   yet been determined. </FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Whatever cause (or combination of causes), the
terminal Permain extinction was a massive and severe crisis for life.
Many groups of organisms went extinct at that time. Surviving groups
diversified during the Triassic period and gradually a more modern
world developed. </FONT></P>
