Extensively used as an ornamental plant, <I>Ginkgo</I> was thought
extinct in the wild until it was discovered growing natively in a
remote area of China. Ginkos are dioecious, with separate male and
female plants. The males are more commonly planted since the females
produce seeds that have a nasty odor. Pollination is by wind.

remain a major group of gymnosperms that include the pines, spruce,
fir, bald cypress and Norfolk Island Pine (<I>Araucaria</I>). The
division Pinophyta contains approximately 550 species of conifers.
The conifers are cone producing trees and shrubs that usually have
evergreen needle-like leaves. Needles have a thick cuticle, sunken
stomates, and a reduced surface area. The conifers, as a group, are
well adapted to withstand extremes in climate and occur in nearly all
habitats from the equator to the subpolar regions. The taiga biome
consists largely of various conifer species. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Pines have an interesting life cycle, shown in
Figure 7, that takes two years to complete. Not all seed plants have
such a long time span to complete their life history: some flowering
plants manage to do it in as little as a few weeks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The sporophyte, as in all other vascular plant
groups, is the dominant, photosynthetic part of the life cycle: when
you are holding pine needles in your hand you are holding sporophyte
parts. Pines have specialized reproductive structures in which
meiosis occurs: pine cones. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pollen grains"><FONT SIZE="+1">Pollen
grains</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> are produced in the male cones, and
contain the male gametophyte (which consists of only a very few
cells).</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Pollen released from the male cones is
carried by wind to the female cones, where it lands. The cones close
and the next year the pollen grain germinates to produce a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pollen tube"><FONT SIZE="+1">pollen
tube</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> that grows into the female
gametophyte.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The sperm cell (from the pollen
grain) and egg cell fuse, forming the next generation
sporophyte.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The sporophyte develops into an
embryo encased within a seed. The seed is later released to be
transported by the wind to where (hopefully) it lands and germinates.
If you have seen a large pine tree you realize there are hundreds or
more female cones on such a tree. Pine pollen has been noted to
travel great distances from the plant that produced it, if the wind
is strong enough. To aid this transport pine pollen has two air sacs,
and thus is quite distinctive, as shown in Figure 8. </FONT></P>

shown in Figure 9, are an odd group: they have some angiosperm-like

support placement of the gnetales (or some portion of them) as
outgroups for the flowering plants. Three distinctive genera comprise
this group: <I>Welwitschia</I>, <I>Gnetum</I>, and <I>Ephedra</I>.
<I>Ephedra</I> occurs in the western United States where it has the
common name "Mormon tea". It is a natural source for the chemical
ephedrine, although there is no evidence the Mormons in Utah (where
the plant is extremely common) ever used it for tea.
<I>Welwitschia</I> is limited to coastal deserts in South Africa,
although fossil leaf, cuticle and pollen evidence indicates plants of
this type were widespread during the Mesozoic Era. <I>Welwitschia</I>
is noted for its two long, prominent leaves. <I>Gnetum</I> has leaves
that look remarkably like those in angiosperms, as well as vessels in
the xylem, generally considered an angiosperm characteristic.

perhaps the best known. One folkloric name for the plant is "Mormon
tea". This is a misnomer as there appears little or no evidence that
members of a religion that bans stimulants such as caffeine ever
brewed a tea from the plant. However, the plant does produce the drug
ephedrine, a stimulant lately linked to deaths of athletes.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Flowering plants also exhibit the typical plant
alternation of generations, shown in Figure 11. The dominant phase is
the sporophyte, with the gametophyte being much reduced in size and
wholly dependant on the sporophyte for nutrition. The is not a unique
angiosperm condition, but occurs in all seed plants as well. What
makes the angiosperms unique is their flowers and the "double
fertilization" that occurs. Technically this is not double
fertilization, but rather a single egg-sperm fusion (fertilization
proper) plus a fusion of the second of two sperm cells with two
haploid cells in the female gametophyte to p&#91;produce triploid

include the mustards, maples, cacti, peas and roses. Several dicot

Plant Evolution | </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Back

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Several evolutionary trends within the plant
kingdom have been noted. The monophyletic nateure of this kingdom is
not in dispute, with the first major division being between vascular
and nonvascular plants. Wihin the vascular plants we see increasing
changes in the relationship between sporophyte and gametophyte,
culminating in flowering plants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Developing from green algal ancestors, plants show
a trend for reduction of the complexity, size, and dominance of the
gametophyte generation. In nonvascular plants the gametophyte is the
conspicuous, photosynthetic, free-living phase of the life cycle.
Conversely, the angiosperm gametophyte is reduced to between three
and eight cells (hence it is very inconspicuous) and is dependent on
the free-living, photosynthetic sporophyte for its nutrition.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Plants also developed and refined the
root-shoot-leaf axis with its specialized conducting cells of the
xylem and phloem.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The earliest vascular
plants, such as <I>Cooksonia</I> and <I>Rhynia</I>, were little more
than naked (unleafed) photosynthetic stems. Some plants later
developed secondary growth that produced wood. Numerous leaf
modifications are known, including "carnivorous" plants such as the
Venus flytrap, as well as plants that have reduced or lost leaves,
such as <I>Psilotum </I>and the cacti. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A third trend is the development of the seed to
promote the dormancy of the embryo. The seed allows the plant to wait
out harsh environmental conditions. With the development of the seed
during the Paleozoic era plants became less prone to mass
extinctions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The fourth trend in plant evolution is the
encasing of a seed within a fruit. The only plant group that produces
true fruit is the flowering plants, the angiosperms. Fruits serve to
protect the seed, as well as aid in seed dispersal. </FONT></P>
