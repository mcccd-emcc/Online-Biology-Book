exists in many forms, such as heat, light, chemical energy, and
electrical energy. Energy is the ability to bring about change or to
do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossF.html#first law of thermodynamics (co"><FONT SIZE="+1">First
Law of Thermodynamics</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">: Energy can be
changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or
destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe
remains constant, merely changing from one form to another. The First
Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that energy is always
conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can
be converted from one form into another. </FONT><A HREF="http://science.clayton.edu/pratte/jmp7.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Click

Univ., GA) covering thermodynamics.</FONT></A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#second law of thermodynamics (e"><FONT SIZE="+1">Second
Law of Thermodynamics</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> states that "in all
energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the
potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the
initial state." This is also commonly referred to as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#entropy"><FONT SIZE="+1">entropy</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
A watchspring-driven watch will run until the potential energy in the
spring is converted, and not again until energy is reapplied to the
spring to rewind it. A car that has run out of gas will not run again
until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel the car. Once the
potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into kinetic
energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more until
energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy
will dissipate as heat. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#entropy"><FONT SIZE="+1">Entropy</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low
entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins
when organisms cease to take in energy and die.</FONT></P>

Kinetic energy | </B><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><B>Back to

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Potential energy, as the name implies, is energy
that has not yet been used, thus the term potential. Kinetic energy
is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain
potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine.
When the potential is used up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new
or recharged, have a certain potential. When placed into a tape
recorder and played at loud volume (the only settings for such
things), the potential in the batteries is transformed into kinetic
energy to drive the speakers. When the potential energy is all used
up, the batteries are dead. In the case of rechargeable batteries,
their potential is reelevated or restored.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the hydrologic cycle, the sun is the ultimate
source of energy, evaporating water (in a fashion raising it's
potential above water in the ocean). When the water falls as rain (or
snow) it begins to run downhill toward sea-level. As the water get
closer to sea-level, it's potential energy is decreased. Without the
sun, the water would eventually still reach sea-level, but never be
evaporated to recharge the cycle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Chemicals may also be considered from a potential
energy or kinetic energy standpoint. One pound of sugar has a certain
potential energy. If that pound of sugar is burned the energy is
released all at once. The energy released is kinetic energy (heat).
So much is released that organisms would burn up if all the energy
was released at once. Organisms must release the energy a little bit
at a time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Cells
convert potential energy, usually in the from of C-C covalent bonds
or ATP molecules, into kinetic energy to accomplish cell division,
growth, biosynthesis, and active transport, among other
things.</FONT></P>
