<H3>The Cambrian: Animals with Hard Body Parts</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Beginning 570 million years ago, early during the
Cambrian time, animals with external skeletons appeared in great
abundance. This sudden appearance of fossils was used to define the
beginning of the Cambrian (named after Cambria, an ancient name for
the country of Wales). External skeletons were hard enough to be more
readily preserved, leading to the apparent explosion of animals early
in the Cambrian. Soft-bodied animals had dominated early animal
evolution during an earlier time just prior to the Cambrian, the
Vendian. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Modern animals are classified into between 30 and
35 phyla: all major modern phyla were present at the beginning of the
Cambrian, along with a great variety of now-extinct phyla recorded in
the Burgess Shale (Cambrian) in Canada. Of the animal phyla,
scientists consider nine major invertebrate phyla and the chordates
to be of major importance in terms of biological diversity. While all
major animal phyla are represented by Cambrian fossils,
reconstructing fossil history is extremely difficult since earlier,
soft-bodied animals did not fossilize well. Consequently,
evolutionary relationships have been established for the most part on
a studies of living (referred to as extant) animal
anatomy.</FONT></P>

<H2><A NAME="Trends in Animal Evolution"></A>Trends in Animal
Evolution | <A HREF="#Table of Contents"><B>Back to Top</B></A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Within the animal kingdom several evolutionary
trends and advancements are seen. Note that not all animal groups
have all of the organs and organ systems found in the "higher
animals", a fact consistent with stepwise evolutionary history . Nor
will their body plans necessarily conform to ours. </FONT></P>

<H3>Body Plans</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most animals have a body plan best described as a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#tube-within-a-tube system"><FONT SIZE="+1">"tube-within-a-tube"</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">This plan calls for two openings: one for food to
enter the body (mouth), one for wastes to leave the body
(</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#anus"><FONT SIZE="+1">anus</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">).
The tube-within-a-tube plan allows specialization of parts along the
tube, such as a stomach, intestine, etc.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The
sac-like body plan has only one opening for both food intake and
waste removal.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Sac-like body plan animals do
not have tissue specialization or development of organs.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Animals with the "tube-within-a-tube" plan are 10%
more efficient at digesting and absorbing their food than animals
with the sac-like body plan.</FONT></P>

<H3>Triploblasty: Three Tissue Layers</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many, but not all, animals produce three embryonic
tissue tissue layers (shown in Table 1) as they develop: the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#endoderm"><FONT SIZE="+1">endoderm</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,

and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#ectoderm"><FONT SIZE="+1">ectoderm</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Some animals, most notably sponges, lack these tissue layers.
Cnidarians (a group including coral and jellyfish) have only two of
these layers, and are termed diploblastic. Flatworms, ribbon worms,
humans, etc. have all three tissue layers, and are triploblastic.

<H3>Asymmetry and Symmetry</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Asymmetrical animals (sponges, shown in Figure 4)

into mirror-image halves.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Within the animal

Radially symmetrical animals are often, for some part of their life,
nonmotile (termed in animals as sessile), and live attached to a
substrate. Radial symmetry allows animals, such as jellyfish, corals,
and sea anemones, to reach out in all directions from one central
point.</FONT> <A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#bilateral symmetry"><FONT SIZE="+1">Bilaterally

sensory organs in the anterior end, or head (a trend known as
cephalization). </FONT></P>

<H3>Class Turbellaria</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Turbellaria includes freshwater planaria
such as <I>Dugesia</I> that feed on small organisms or the remains of
small creatures, as well as often colorful marine forms. Their small
size and ease of care also make <EM>Dugesia</EM> a common animals in
introductory biology labs. The planarian head is normally
arrow-shaped, with side extensions that are sensory organs for
detection of food and the presence of other organisms. Flatworms have
two light-sensitive eyespots that have pigmentation making them look
cross-eyed. The presence of three muscle layers facilitates varied
movement. Gland cells secrete a mucous material upon which the animal
slides or glides. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The animal captures food by wrapping itself around
its prey, entangling it in slime, and pinning it down. The
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pharynx"><FONT SIZE="+1">pharynx</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a muscular tube that extrudes from the mouth and through which
food is ingested. Often in biology labs the "prey" can be liver and
students can watch the pharynx extend out of the worm's body.

consists of a series of interconnecting canals that run length of the
body on either side of the longitudinal axis and side branches of the
canals, each ending in a flame cell. The flame cell is a bulb-shaped
cell containing a tuft of cilia within the hollow interior of the
bulb. The cilia move back and forth, bringing water into the canals
that empty through pores at the body surface. This flame-cell system
functions in both water excretion and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#osmosis"><FONT SIZE="+1">osmotic</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
regulation in a typical freshwater, free-living flatworm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Planaria can reproduce both sexually and
asexually. They can constrict beneath the pharynx and each half will
grow into a whole animal by the process of regeneration. Planaria are
hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female sex organs, and can
cross-fertilize each other. Fertilized eggs are enclosed in a cocoon
and hatch in two to three weeks. </FONT></P>

<H3>Class Trematoda</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Trematoda includes flukes. Flukes, such
as blood, liver, and lung flukes are named after the organs they
inhabit. Fluke bodies tend to be oval and elongate. They lack a
definite head but have an oral sucker surrounded by sensory papillae.
Flukes have reduced digestive, nervous, and excretory systems.
Reproductive systems are well developed and usually
hermaphroditic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The blood fluke, shown in Figure 20, causes
schistosomiasis, a disease found predominantly in tropical Africa and
South America. Unlike most flukes, blood flukes are male or female.
Flukes deposit eggs in blood vessels around the host's intestine. The
eggs migrate to the intestine and are passed out with feces. Larvae
hatch in water and swim about until they detect and enter a
particular species of snail. The larvae reproduce asexually and
eventually leave the snail. Once larvae penetrate human skin they
begin to mature in the liver, and implant in blood vessels of the

<H3>Class Cestoda</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Cestoda consists of the tapeworms, an
example of which is shown in Figure 22. The tapeworm scolex
(head/neck region) has hooks and suckers that allow the organism to
attach to the host's intestinal wall. Behind the head is a short neck
and then a long string of proglottids. Each proglottid segment
contains a full set of both male and female sex organs and very
little other structure. Since the animal does produce wastes, it
retains its excretory canals, but no digestive system is needed.
Being sessile organisms in a fairly stable environment, tapeworms
have only rudiments of nerves. Following fertilization, proglottids
become a bag of eggs that when mature, breaks off and passes out with
feces. If the eggs of tapeworms are ingested by pigs or cattle, the
larvae become encysted in the muscle of the hosts. The covering of
ingested eggs is digested away and the larvae burrow through the
intestinal wall and travel by bloodstream to lodge and encyst in
muscle; a cyst is a hard-walled structure sheltering a larval worm.
If humans eat the meat of infected pigs or cattle and fail to cook it
properly, they too become infected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The phylum Nemertea include approximately 650
species of marine ribbon worms. Ribbon worms have a distinctive
eversible proboscis stored in a rhynchocoel. When the walls of the
rhynchocoel contract, the proboscis extends out of the body. The
proboscis is a long, hollow tube that can be everted and shot outward
through a pore located just above the mouth. It is used primarily for
prey capture, and for defense, locomotion, and burrowing. This phylum
is included as the organisms are also triploblastic. Several of the
fossils from the Cambrian-aged Burgess Shale are interpreted as
ribbon worms, and some extremely long worms have been found in the
Mediterranean (up to 100 feet long) and in the ocean under the
Antarctic ice shelves. </FONT></P>

complete the life cycle, thus, proper sanitation is an important
aspect to prevent infection.</FONT></P>
