<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Despite differences between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, there are several common features in their cell division
processes. Replication of the DNA must occur. Segregation of the
"original" and its "replica" follow. Cytokinesis ends the cell
division process. Whether the cell was eukaryotic or prokaryotic,
these basic events must occur.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cytokinesis"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cytokinesis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is the process where one cell splits off from its sister cell. It
usually occurs after cell division. The Cell Cycle is the sequence of
growth, DNA replication, growth and cell division that all cells go
through. Beginning after cytokinesis, the daughter cells are quite
small and low on ATP. They acquire ATP and increase in size during
the G1 phase of Interphase. Most cells are observed in Interphase,
the longest part of the cell cycle. After acquiring sufficient size
and ATP, the cells then undergo DNA Synthesis (replication of the
original DNA molecules, making identical copies, one "new molecule"
eventually destined for each new cell) which occurs during the S
phase. Since the formation of new DNA is an energy draining process,
the cell undergoes a second growth and energy acquisition stage, the
G2 phase. The energy acquired during G2 is used in cell division (in
this case mitosis).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Regulation of the cell cycle is accomplished in
several ways. Some cells divide rapidly (beans, for example take 19
hours for the complete cycle; red blood cells must divide at a rate
of 2.5 million per second). Others, such as nerve cells, lose their
capability to divide once they reach maturity. Some cells, such as
liver cells, retain but do not normally utilize their capacity for
division. Liver cells will divide if part of the liver is removed.
The division continues until the liver reaches its former
size.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Cancer cells are those which undergo a series of
rapid divisions such that the daughter cells divide before they have
reached "functional maturity". Environmental factors such as changes
in temperature and pH, and declining nutrient levels lead to
declining cell division rates. When cells stop dividing, they stop
usually at a point late in the G1 phase, the R point (for
restriction).</FONT></P>

are much simpler in their organization than are eukaryotes. There are
a great many more organelles in eukaryotes, also more chromosomes.
The usual method of prokaryote cell division is termed
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#binary fission"><FONT SIZE="+1">binary
fission</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. The prokaryotic chromosome is a
single DNA molecule that first replicates, then attaches each copy to
a different part of the cell membrane. When the cell begins to pull
apart, the replicate and original chromosomes are separated.
Following cell splitting (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cytokinesis"><FONT SIZE="+1">cytokinesis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">),
there are then two cells of identical genetic composition (except for
the rare chance of a spontaneous mutation).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The prokaryote chromosome is much easier to
manipulate than the eukaryotic one. We thus know much more about the
location of genes and their control in prokaryotes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">One consequence of this asexual method of
reproduction is that all organisms in a colony are genetic equals.
When treating a bacterial disease, a drug that kills one bacteria (of
a specific type) will also kill all other members of that clone
(colony) it comes in contact with.</FONT></P>

is the process of forming (generally) identical daughter cells by
replicating and dividing the original chromosomes, in effect making a
cellular xerox. Commonly the two processes of cell division are
confused. Mitosis deals only with the segregation of the chromosomes

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During mitosis replicated chromosomes are
positioned near the middle of the cytoplasm and then segregated so
that each daughter cell receives a copy of the original DNA (if you
start with 46 in the parent cell, you should end up with 46
chromosomes in each daughter cell). To do this cells utilize
microtubules (referred to as the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#spindle apparatus"><FONT SIZE="+1">spindle
apparatus</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">) to "pull" chromosomes into each
"cell". The microtubules have the 9+2 arrangement discussed earlier.
Animal cells (except for a group of worms known as nematodes) have a

Plants and most other eukaryotic organisms lack centrioles.
Prokaryotes, of course, lack spindles and centrioles; the cell
membrane assumes this function when it pulls the by-then replicated
chromosomes apart during binary fission. Cells that contain
centrioles also have a series of smaller microtubules, the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#aster"><FONT SIZE="+1">aster</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
that extend from the centrioles to the cell membrane. The aster is
thought to serve as a brace for the functioning of the spindle
fibers.</FONT></P>
