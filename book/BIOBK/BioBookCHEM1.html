Energy is the capacity to do work. Matter has mass and occupies
space. All matter is composed of basic elements that cannot be broken
down to substances with different chemical or physical properties.

for example Carbon atoms make up diamond, and also graphite. Pure
(24K) gold is composed of only one type of atom, gold atoms. Atoms
are the smallest particle into which an element can be divided. The
ancient Greek philosophers developed the concept of the atom,
although they considered it the fundamental particle that could not
be broken down. Since the work of </FONT><A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/fermi_biography.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Enrico
Fermi</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> and his colleagues, we now know that
the atom <B>is</B> divisible, often releasing tremendous energies as
in nuclear explosions or (in a controlled fashion in) thermonuclear
power plants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Subatomic particles were discovered during the
1800s. For our purposes we will concentrate only on three of them,
summarized in Table 1. The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#proton"><FONT SIZE="+1">proton</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is located in the center (or </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#nucleus (atom)"><FONT SIZE="+1">nucleus</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)
of an atom, each atom has at least one proton. Protons have a charge
of +1, and a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu). Elements
differ from each other in the number of protons they have, e.g.
Hydrogen has 1 proton; Helium has 2.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#neutron"><FONT SIZE="+1">neutron</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
also is located in the atomic nucleus (except in Hydrogen). The
neutron has no charge, and a mass of slightly over 1 amu. Some
scientists propose the neutron is made up of a proton and
electron-like particle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#electron"><FONT SIZE="+1">electron</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a very small particle located outside the nucleus. Because they
move at speeds near the speed of light the precise location of
electrons is hard to pin down. Electrons occupy orbitals, or areas
where they have a high statistical probability of occurring. The
charge on an electron is -1. Its mass is negligible (approximately
1800 electrons are needed to equal the mass of one
proton).</FONT></P>

deciphered by using isotopic tracers. The age of fossils and
artifacts can be determined by using radioactive isotopes, either
directly on the fossil (if it is young enough) or on the rocks that
surround the fossil (for older fossils like dinosaurs). Isotopes are
also the source of radiation used in medical diagnostic and treatment

separating energy from matter. Albert Einstein developed his famous
E=mc<SUP>2</SUP> equation relating matter and energy over a century

particles of matter (having mass is a property of matter) and as
units (or quanta) of energy. When subjected to energy, electrons will

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the nineteenth century, chemists arranged
the then-known elements according to chemical bonding, recognizing
that one group (the furthermost right column on the Periodic Table,
referred to as the Inert Gases or Noble Gases) tended to occur in
elemental form (in other words, not in a molecule with other
elements). It was later determined that this group had outer electron
shells containing two (as in the case of Helium) or eight (Neon,
Xenon, Radon, Krypton, etc.) electrons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">As a general rule, for the atoms we are likely to
encounter in biological systems, atoms tend to gain or lose their
outer electrons to achieve a Noble Gas outer electron shell
configuration of two or eight electrons. The number of electrons that
are gained or lost is characteristic for each element, and ultimately
determines the number and types of chemical bonds atoms of that
element can form. Atomic diagrams for several atoms are shown in
Figure 6. </FONT></P>

Sodium is in another group with elements having one electron in their

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Sometimes electrons tend to spend more time with
one atom in the bond than with the other. In such cases a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#polar covalent bond"><FONT SIZE="+1">polar
covalent bond</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> develops. Water
(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) is an example. Since the electrons spend so much
time with the oxygen (oxygen having a greater electronegativity, or
electron affinity) that end of the molecule acquires a slightly
negative charge. Conversely, the loss of the electrons from the
hydrogen end leaves a slightly positive charge. The water molecule is
thus polar, having positive and negative sides.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hydrogen bond"><FONT SIZE="+1">Hydrogen
bonds</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, as shown in Figure 11, result from
the weak electrical attraction between the positive end of one
molecule and the negative end of another. Individually these bonds
are very weak, although taken in a large enough quantity, the result
is strong enough to hold molecules together or in a three-dimensional
shape. </FONT></P>

water, glucose, ATP. Mixtures are compounds with variable
