<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Jaundice occurs when the characteristic yellow
tint to the skin is caused by excess hemoglobin breakdown products in
the blood, a sign that the liver is not properly functioning.
Jaundice may occur when liver function has been impaired by
obstruction of the bile duct and by damage caused by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hepatitis B"><FONT SIZE="+1">hepatitis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viral diseases that
can cause liver damage. Like any viral disease, the major treatment
efforts focus on treatment of symptoms, not removal of the viral
cause. Hepatitis A is usually mild malady indicated by a sudden
fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. Jaundice
follows up for several days. The virus causing Hepatitis A is
primarilly transmitted by fecal contamination, although contaminated
food and water also can promote transmission. A rare disease in the
United States, hepatitis B is endemic in parts of Asia where hundreds
of millions of individuals are possibly infected. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis B may be transmitted by blood and blood
products as well as sexual contact. The blood supply in developed
countries has been screened for the virus that causes this disease
for many years and transmission by blood transfusion is rare. The
risk of HBV infection is high among promiscuous homosexual men
although it is also transmitted hetereosexually. Correct use of
condoms is thought to reduce or eliminate the risk of transmission.
Effective vaccines are available for the prevention of Hepatitis B
infection. Some individuals with chronic hepatitis B may develop
cirrhosis of the liver. Individuals with chronic hepatitis B are at
an increased risk of developing primary liver cancer. Although this
type of cancer is relatively rare in the United States, it is the
leading cause of cancer death in the world, primarily because the
virus causing it is endemic in eastern Asia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis C affects approximately 170 million
people worldwide and 4 million in the United States. The virus is
transmitted primarily by blood and blood products. Most infected
individuals have either received blood transfusions prior to 1990
(when screening of the blood supply for the Hepatitis C virus began)
or have used intravenous drugs. Sexual transmission can occur between
monogamous couples (rare) but infection is far more common in those
who are promiscuous. In rare cases, Hepatitis C causes acute disease
and even liver failure. About twenty percent of individuals with
Hepatitis C who develop cirrhosis of the liver will also develop
severe liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C is presently
the leading cause of the need for liver transplants in the United
States. Individuals with cirrhosis from Hepatitis C also bear
increased chances of developing primary liver cancer. All current
treatments for Hepatitis C employ of various preparations of the
potent antiviral interferon alpha. However, not all patients who have
the disease are good candidates for treatment, so infected
individuals are urged to regularly consult their physician.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Cirrhosis of the liver commonly occurs in
alcoholics, who place the liver in a stress situation due to the
amount of alcohol to be broken down. Cirrhosis can cause the liver to
become unable to perform its biochemical functions. Chemicals
responsible for blood clotting are synthesized in the liver, as is
albumin, the major protein in blood. The liver also makes or modifies
bile components. Blood from the circulatory system passes through the
liver, so many of the body's metabolic functions occur primarily
there including the metabolism of cholesterol and the conversion of
proteins and fats into glucose. Cirrhosis is a disease resulting from
damage to liver cells due to toxins, inflammation, and other causes.
Liver cells regenerate in an abnormal pattern primarily forming
nodules that are surrounded by fibrous tissue. Changes in the
structure of the liver can decrease blood flow, leading to secondary
complications. Cirrhosis has many cuses, including alcoholic liver
disease, severe forms of some viral hepatitis, congestive heart
failure, parasitic infections (for example schistosomiasis), and long
term exposure to toxins or drugs. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Pancreas</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pancreas"><FONT SIZE="+1">pancreas</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
sends pancreatic juice, which neutralizes the chyme, to the small
intestive through the pancreatic duct. In addition to this digestive
function, the pancrease is the site of production of several
hormones, such as glucagon and insulin. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The pancreas contains exocrine cells that secrete
digestive enzymes into the small intestine and clusters of endocrine
cells (the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pancreatic islets"><FONT SIZE="+1">pancreatic

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">After a meal, blood glucose levels rise, prompting
the release of insulin, which causes cells to take up glucose, and
liver and skeletal muscle cells to form the carbohydrate
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossG.html#glycogen"><FONT SIZE="+1">glycogen</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
As glucose levels in the blood fall, further insulin production is
inhibited. Glucagon causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose,
which in turn is released into the blood to maintain glucose levels
within a homeostatic range. Glucagon production is stimulated when
blood glucose levels fall, and inhibited when they rise. </FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#diabetes mellitus, Types I and "><FONT SIZE="+1">Diabetes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
results from inadequate levels of insulin. Type I diabetes is
characterized by inadequate levels of insulin secretion, often due to
a genetic cause. Type II usually develops in adults from both genetic
and environmental causes. Loss of response of targets to insulin
rather than lack of insulin causes this type of diabetes. Diabetes
may cause impairment in the functioning of the eyes, circulatory
system, nervous system, and failure of the kidneys. Diabetes is the
second leading cause of blindness in the United States. Treatments
might involve daily injections of insulin, oral medications such as
metformin, monitoring of blood glucose levels, and a controlled diet.
Type I diabetes may one day be cured by advances in gene therapy/stem
cell research. On recently recognized condition is known as
prediabetes, in which the body gradually loses its sensitivity to
insulin, leading eventually to Type II diabetes. Ora; medications,
diet and behavior (in other words EXERCISE!!!) changes are thought to
delay if not outright postpone the onset of diabetes if corrected
soon enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The fifth leading cause of cancer death in the
United States is from pancreatic cancer, which is nearly always
fatal. Scientists estimate that 25,000 people may die from this
disease each year. Standard treatments are ineffective, although some
promising avenues may open with advances in genomics and molecular
biology of cancer cells. </FONT></P>

residue and liquid. Movements are due to involuntary contractions
that shuffle contents back and forth and propulsive contractions that

performs three basic functions in vertebrates: 1) recovery of water
and electrolytes from digested food; 2) formation and storage of
feces; and 3) microbial fermentation: The large intestine supports an
amazing flora of microbes. Those microbes produce enzymes that can

the production of secretin, which in turn promotes release of
alkaline secretions from the pancreas, stops further passage of food
into the intestine until the acid is neutralized. Cholecystokinin

carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids. Water is essential, correct
water balance is a must for proper functioning of the
body.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">About 60% of the diet should be carbohydrates,
obtained from foods such as milk, meat, vegetables, grains and grain
products. The diet should contain at least 100 grams of carbohydrate
every day. Recently, however, new recommendations have been developed
that suggest a lowering of the amount of carbohydrate. A more

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Proteins are polymers composed of amino acids.
Proteins are found in meat, milk, poultry, fish, cereal grains and
beans. They are needed for cellular growth and repair. Twenty amino
acids are found in proteins, of which humans can make eleven. The
remaining nine are the essential amino acids which must be supplied
in the diet. Normally proteins are not used for energy, however
during starvation (or a low-carb diet) muscle proteins are broken
down for energy. Excess protein can be used for energy or converted
to fats.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Lipids and fats generate the greatest energy
yield, so a large number of plants and animals store excess food
energy as fats. Lipids and fats are present in oils, meats, butter,
and plants (such as avocado and peanuts). Some fatty acids, such as
linoleic acid, are essential and must be included in the diet. When
present in the intestine, lipids promote the uptake of vitamins A, D,
E, and K. </FONT></P>
