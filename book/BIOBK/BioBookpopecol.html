<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In previous chapters/units we have concentrated on
the biology of the individual cell, tissue, and organism. There are
levels of organization above the individual organism that will be the
subject of this unit. Individual organisms are grouped into
populations, which in turn form communities, which form ecosystems.
Ecosystems make up the biosphere, which includes all life on Earth.
If there is life on other planets, will we need another level of
organization?</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#biosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">Biosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The sum of all living things taken in conjunction with their
environment. In essence, where life occurs, from the upper reaches of
the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to the bottoms of the
oceans. We divide the earth into </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#atmosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">atmosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

(water), and biosphere (life).</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#ecosystem"><FONT SIZE="+1">Ecosystem</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The relationships of a smaller groups of organisms with each other
and their environment. Scientists often speak of the interrelatedness
of living things. Since, according to Darwin's theory, organisms
adapt to their environment, they must also adapt to other organisms
in that environment. We can discuss the flow of energy through an
ecosystem from photosynthetic autotrophs to herbivores to
carnivores.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#community"><FONT SIZE="+1">Community</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The relationships between groups of different species. For example,
the desert communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds,
mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus (<I>Carnegia gigantea</I>),
Ocotillo, creosote bush, etc. Community structure can be disturbed by
such things as fire, human activity, and over-population.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#species"><FONT SIZE="+1">Species</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate and produce viable,
fertile offspring. We often find species described not by their
reproduction (a biological species) but rather by their form
(anatomical or form species).</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#population"><FONT SIZE="+1">Populations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate with each other in a
limited geographic area. This can be as simple as a field of flowers,
which is separated from another field by a hill or other area where
none of these flowers occur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Individuals: One or more cells characterized by a
unique arrangement of DNA "information". These can be unicellular or
multicellular. The multicellular individual exhibits specialization
of cell types and division of labor into tissues, organs, and organ
systems.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#organ systems"><FONT SIZE="+1">Organ
System</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">: (in multicellular organisms). A
group of cells, tissues, and organs that perform a specific major
function. For example: the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cardiovascular system"><FONT SIZE="+1">cardiovascular
system</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> functions in circulation of
blood.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#organs"><FONT SIZE="+1">Organ</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
(in multicellular organisms). A group of cells or tissues performing
an overall function. For example: the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#heart"><FONT SIZE="+1">heart</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is an organ that pumps blood within the cardiovascular
system.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#tissues"><FONT SIZE="+1">Tissue</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
(in multicellular organisms). A group of cells performing a specific
function. For example </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cardiac muscle"><FONT SIZE="+1">heart
muscle tissue</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is found in the heart and
its unique contraction properties aid the heart's functioning as a
pump. .</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cells"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cell</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The fundamental unit of living things. Each cell has some sort of
hereditary material (either DNA or more rarely RNA), energy acquiring
chemicals, structures, etc. Living things, by definition, must have
the metabolic chemicals plus a nucleic acid hereditary information
molecule.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#organelles"><FONT SIZE="+1">Organelle</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
A subunit of a cell, an organelle is involved in a specific
subcellular function, for example the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#ribosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">ribosome</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same
geographic area. The study of factors that affect growth, stability,

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Nearly all populations will tend to grow
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#exponential rate"><FONT SIZE="+1">exponentially</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
as long as there are resources available. Most populations have the
potential to expand at an exponential rate, since reproduction is
generally a multiplicative process. Two of the most basic factors
that affect the rate of population growth are the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#birth rate"><FONT SIZE="+1">birth
rate</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, and the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#death rate"><FONT SIZE="+1">death
rate</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. The intrinsic rate of increase is
the birth rate minus the death rate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Two modes of population growth. The Exponential
curve (also known as a J-curve) occurs when there is no limit to
population size. The Logistic curve (also known as an S-curve) shows
the effect of a limiting factor (in this case the carrying capacity
of the environment). </FONT>Image from Purves et al., <U>Life: The

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Population Growth Potential Is Related to Life
History</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The age within it's individual life cycle at which
an organism reproduces affects the rate of population increase.
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#life history"><FONT SIZE="+1">Life
history</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> refers to the age of sexual
maturity, age of death, and other events in that individual's
lifetime that influence reproductive traits. Some organisms grow
fast, reproduce quickly, and have abundant offspring each
reproductive cycle. Other organisms grow slowly, reproduce at a late
age, and have few offspring per cycle. Most organisms are
intermediate to these two extremes. </FONT></P>

the age classes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Human populations are in a growth phase. Since
evolving about 200,000 years ago, our species has proliferated and
spread over the Earth. Beginning in 1650, the slow population
increases of our species exponentially increased. New technologies
for hunting and farming have enabled this expansion. It took 1800
years to reach a total population of 1 billion, but only 130 years to
reach 2 billion, and a mere 45 years to reach 4 billion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Despite technological advances, factors
influencing population growth will eventually limit expansion of
human population. These will involve limitation of physical and

billion. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Several Basic Controls Govern Population
Size</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The environment is the ultimate cause of
population stabilization.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Two categories of
factors are commonly used: physical environment and biological
environment. Three subdivisions of the biological environment are
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#competition"><FONT SIZE="+1">competition</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
predation, and symbiosis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Physical environment factors include food,
shelter, water supply, space availability, and (for plants) soil and
light.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">One of these factors may severely limit
population size, even if the others are not as constrained.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#law of the minimum"><FONT SIZE="+1">Law
of the Minimum</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> states that population
growth is limited by the resource in the shortest supply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The biological role played by a species in the
environment is called a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#niche"><FONT SIZE="+1">niche</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Organisms/populations in competition have a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#niche overlap"><FONT SIZE="+1">niche

they compete. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#competitive exclusion"><FONT SIZE="+1">Competitive

unaffected themselves. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">The Real World Has a Complex Interaction of
Population Controls</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Natural populations are not governed by a single
control, but rather have the combined effects of many controls
simultaneously playing roles in determining population size. If two
beetle species interact in the laboratory, one result occurs; if a
third species is introduced, a different outcome develops.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">The latter situation is more like nature, and changes
in one population may have a domino effect on others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Which factors, if either, is more important in
controlling population growth: physical or biological?</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Physical factors may play a dominant role, and are
called density independent regulation, since population density is
not a factor</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The other extreme has biological
factors dominant, and is referred to as density dependent regulation,
since population density is a factor. It seems likely that one or the
other extreme may dominate in some environments, with most
environments having a combination control.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Population Decline and Extinction</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Extinction is the elimination of all individuals
in a group.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Local extinction is the loss of
all individuals in a population.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Species
extinction occurs when all members of a species and its component
populations go extinct.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists estimate
that 99% of all species that ever existed are now extinct. The
ultimate cause of decline and extinction is environmental
change.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Changes in one of the physical factors
of the environment may cause the decline and extinction; likewise the
fossil record indicates that some extinctions are caused by migration
of a competitor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Dramatic declines in human population happen
periodically in response to an infectious disease.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Bubonic plague infections killed half of Europe's
population between 1346 and 1350, later plagues until 1700 killed one
quarter of the European populace. Smallpox and other diseases
decimated indigenous populations in North and South
America.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Human Impact</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Human populations have continued to increase, due
to use of technology that has disrupted natural populations.
Destabilization of populations leads to possible outcomes:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Agriculture and animal domestication are examples
of population increase of favored organisms.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">In England alone more than 300,000 cats are put to
sleep per year, yet before their domestication, the wild cat
ancestors were rare and probably occupied only a small area in the
Middle East.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Pollution</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Pollutants generally are (unplanned?) releases of
substances into the air and water.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Many lakes
often have nitrogen and phosphorous as limiting nutrients for aquatic
and terrestrial plants.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Runoff from
agricultural fertilizers increases these nutrients, leading to
runaway plant growth, or eutrophication. Increased plant populations
eventually lead to increased bacterial populations that reduce oxygen
levels in the water, causing fish and other organisms to
suffocate.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Pesticides and Competition</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Removal of a competing species can cause the
ecological release of a population explosion in that species
competitor. Pesticides sprayed on wheat fields often result in a
secondary pest outbreak as more-tolerant-to-pesticide species expand
once less tolerant competitors are removed.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Removal of Predators</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Predator release is common where humans hunt,
trap, or otherwise reduce predator populations, allowing the prey
population to increase.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Elimination of wolves
and panthers have led to increase in their natural prey: deer. There
are more deer estimated in the United States than there were when
Europeans arrived.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Large deer populations
often cause over grazing that in turn leads to starvation of the
deer. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Introduction of New Species</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Introduction of exotic or alien non-native species
into new areas is perhaps the greatest single factor to affect
natural populations.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">More than 1500 exotic
insect species and more than 25 families of alien fish have been
introduced into North America; in excess of 3000 plant species have
also been introduced.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The majority of
accidental introductions may fail, however, once an introduced
species becomes established, its population growth is explosive.

Population Growth | </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Back
to Top</B></FONT></A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Humans can remove or alter the constraints on
population sizes, with both good and bad consequences.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">On the negative side, about 17% of the 1500
introduced insect species require the use of pesticides to control
them. For example, African killer bees are expanding their population
and migrating from northward from South America.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">These killer bees are much more agressive than the
natives, and destroy native honeybee populations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">On a positive note, human-induced population
explosions can provide needed resources for growing human
populations. Agriculture now produces more food per acre, allowing
and sustaining increased human population size.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Human action is causing the extinction of species
at thousands of times the natural rate.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Extinction is caused by alteration of a population's
environment in a harmful way.</FONT> <A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#habitat disruption"><FONT SIZE="+1">Habitat
disruption</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is the disturbance of the
physical environment of a species, for example cutting a forest or
draining wetlands.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Habitat disruption in
currently the leading cause of extinction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes in the biological environment occur in
three ways.</FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Species introduction: An exotic species is
   introduced into an area where it may have no predfators to control
   its population size, or where it can gratly out compete native
   organisms. Examples include zebra mussels introduced into Lake
   Erie, and lake trout released into Yellowstone Lake where they are
   threatening the native cutthroat trout populations.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Overhunting: When a predator population
   increases or becomes more efficient at killing the prey, the prey
   population may decline or go extinct. Examples today include big
   game hunting, which has in many places reduced the predator (or in
   this case prey) population. In human prehistory we may have caused
   the extinction of the mammoths and mastodons due to increased
   human hunting skill.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Secondary extinction: Loss of food species can
   cause migration or extinction of any species that depends largely
   or solely on that species as a food source. </FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Overkill is the shooting, trapping, or hunting of
a species usually for sport or economic reasons.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Unfortunately, this cannot eliminate "pest" species
like cockroaches and mice due to their large population sizes and
capacity to reproduce more rapidly than we can eliminate them.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">However, many large animals have been eliminated or
had their populations drastically reduced (such as tigers, elephants,
and leopards). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The death of one species or population can cause
the decline or elimination of others, a process known as secondary
extinction. Destruction of bamboo forests in China, the food for the
giant panda, may cause the extinction of the panda. The</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">extinction of the dodo bird has caused the Calviera
tree to become unable to reproduce since the dodo ate the fruit and
processed the seeds of that tree.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Populations Have a Minimum Viable
Size</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Even if a number of individuals survive, the
population size may become too small for the species to
continue.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Small populations may have breeding
problems.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">They are susceptible to random
environmental fluctuations and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossG.html#genetic drift"><FONT SIZE="+1">genetic
drift</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> to a greater degree than are larger
populations. The chance of extinction increases exponentially with
decreasing population size.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#minimum viable population (MVP)"><FONT SIZE="+1">minimum
viable population (MVP)</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is the smallest
population size that can avoid extinction by the two reasons listed
above. If no severe environmental fluxes develop for a long enough
time, a small population will recover.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The MVP
depends heavily on reproductive rates of the species.</FONT></P>

<H2><A NAME="Range and Density"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Range and Density
| </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Back to
Top</B></FONT></A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Populations tend to have a maximum density near
the center of their geographic range. Geographic range is the total
area occupied by the species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Outlying zones,
where conditions are less optimal, include the zone of physiological
stress (where individuals are rare), and eventually the zone of
intolerance (where individuals are not found). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The environment is usually never uniform enough to
support uniform distribution of a species. Species thus have a
dispersion pattern.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Three patterns found
include uniform, clumped, and random. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Geographic ranges of species are dynamic, over
time they can contract or expand due to environmental change or human
activity. Often a species will require another species' presence, for
example <I>Drosophila</I> in Hawaii. Species ranges can also expand
due to human actions: brown trout are now found worldwide because of
the sprerad of trout fishing. </FONT></P>
