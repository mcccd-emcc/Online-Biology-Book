<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Unlike marine animals, terrestrial plants for the
most part (save the cordaites) escaped the great Permian extinction.
The Triassic was a period of transition for the world's floras, as
Paleozoic plants such as the calamites and lycopsids declined in
favor of newer gymnosperm groups such as the "cycads". During the
Triassic up to 20% of the world's flora consisted of cycads, the acme
of the group that today has declined to but a few genera restricted
to the tropics. </FONT></P>

although recent studies suggest these genera are really morphological
variants and that the modern genus <I>Ginkgo</I> should be used to
include these fossils. During the Mesozoic ginkgoes were worldwide in
their distribution and important elements in the gymnosperm forests
that dominated the land. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The diapsids, the "reptiles" except for turtles
and a few extinct forms, rose to prominence during the latter
Triassic times. Diapsids, you recall, have two openings in the skull
behind the eye socket. While the diapsids had originated possibly as
far back as the late Carboniferous, they did not become major
elements of the fauna until the Triassic. The major group of
diapsids, the archosaurs (ruling reptiles) evolved in the later part
of the Permian, and underwent a major adaptive radiation in the late
Triassic. Today only the birds and crocodiles remain of the once
dominant ruling reptile group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The first true crocodiles also appeared during the
Triassic. Several other reptile groups, such as the Triassic
phytosaurs, adapted to the environment that crocodiles lived in. Due
to </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#convergent evolution"><FONT SIZE="+1">evolutionary

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">One early archosaur was <I>Euparkeria</I>, a
small, Triassic-aged, quadrupedal reptile that some scientists think
may have been able to run short distances on its hind legs.
<I>Euparkeria</I> specimens reach about 0.5 meters in length. The

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The dinosaurs have traditionally been classified
into two distinct taxonomic classes, the saurischia (lizard-hipped)
and ornithischia (bird-hipped). This divergence was accomplished by
the close of the Triassic. The ancestors of dinosaurs were some
unspecified thecodont earlier in the Triassic. The Saurischia, which
includes <I>Dilophosaurus</I> and <I>Coelophysis</I>, has two main
groups, the theropods and the sauropods. The theropods were bipedal
carnivores that included the famous <I>Velociraptor</I> and
<I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I> as well as birds. Sauropods and similar
forms were quadrupedal, mostly herbovorous forms that include the
giants of the Jurassic: <I>Apatosaurus</I>, <I>Diplodicus</I>, and
<I>Brachiosaurus</I>. The recently discovered Arizona dinosaur
<I>Sonorasaurus</I> belongs in this group as well. Ornithischians
were all herbivourous, with some retaining a bipedal gait, and others
returning to four legs, and included: the ornithopods (such as
<I>Trachodon</I> and <I>Maiasaurus</I>), ceratopsians (such as
<I>Triceratops</I>), and the stegosaurians (including
<I>Stegosaurus</I> and <I>Ankylosaurus</I>). </FONT></P>

Triassic. The conditions from the Permian (dry continental interiors,
few if any shallow marginal continental seas) continued. Around the
middle of the Triassic the breakup of Pangaea began, with the
supercontinent separating into two landmasses, Gondwana in the south
(composed of the future continents of South America, Africa, India,
Antarctica, and Australia) and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#Laurasia"><FONT SIZE="+1">Laurasia</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At the end of the Triassic a minor mass extinction
occurred. The cause of this is still in dispute, although the
consensus opinion involves global cooling associated with an asteroid
impact or comet showers. The victims of this event included the

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Jurassic period spanned the time interval from
208 to 146 million years ago. The major events of the Jurassic were
the explosive adaptive radiation of dinosaurs and the evolution of
birds (sometimes referred to as the avian dinosaurs), the
diversification of the cycads, seed ferns and the "cycadeoids", and
the continued breakup of Pangaea. The opening of the Atlantic Ocean
between Africa and North America created new shallow-water
environments, as did the global rise of sea-levels that occurred
during the Jurassic. As you might expect, marine life responded with
a burst of adaptation and the appearance of new forms. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Life in Water</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The separation of Pangaea caused the formation of
new oceans, such as the Atlantic. It also led to a global rise in
sea-level. Consequently there were many more environmental spaces
open for exploitation. Since the Trissic extinction was not nearly as
calamitous as the Permian one, life rebounded much
quicker.</FONT></P>

saurischians, the ornithischians became more prominent during the
Jurassic. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The small, bipedal saurischians of the Triassic
continued in the Jurassic, as exemplified by <I>Ornithomimus</I>.
This dinosaur had no teeth in its jaws, a bird-like head, and a long,
ostrich-like neck, was around 3 meters long and weighed approximately
100-150 kg. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The true giants of the finosaur world were the
sauropods. These quadrupedal, herbivores included <I>Apatosaurus</I>,
<I>Brachiosaurus</I>, and <I>Diplodocus</I>. Paleontologists believe
that the sauropod clade evolved from a Triassic ancestor similar to
<I>Plateosaurus</I>. Sauropods ate numerous types of plants, often
specializing in plants of a certain height. Since the teeth of
sauropods are not adapted for grinding, this mechanical part of the
digestive process was accomplished in their stomachs. Sauropod
skeletons are often found in association with curiosuly rounded
stones in the approximate position of the stomach. These "stomach
stones" are known as gastroliths, and served a similar function in
sauropods as bird gravel does in birds: to aid digestion of plant
material not ground up enough in the mouth. Gastroliths are not
unique to sauropods, as many other herbivorous dinosaurs and
plesiosaurs have been found with stomach stones. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Apatosaurus</I>, once much better known as
"Brontosaurus", was a herbivore from the Jurassic deposits in the
western United States that ranged from 21 to 26 meters long, and had
an estimated weight of between 30 and 35 tons. For over 100 years
after its discovery, <I>Apatosaurus</I> skeleton was fitted with the
wrong head. During the 1980s the error was discovered and the correct
head (which had been descxribed separately from the skeleton) wwas
attached. Owing to the rules of zoological nomenclature, the
recponstructed fossil would take the name of the oldest described
part, in this case the head. Thus paleontology lost a truly great
scientific name, <I>Brontosaurus</I>, which literally means "thunder
lizard". The name "Brontosaurus" is invalid and the correct name is
<I>Apatosaurus</I>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Naming was not the only error. <I>Apatosaurus</I>
weighed over 30 tons when alive, and early paleontologists considered
the animal too heavy to have lived on land. The frequently drew

the animal's weight. In modern reconstructions of the the
<I>Apatosaurus</I> environment the vegetation is not swampy but

been a fully terrestrial animal. </FONT></P>

as a great deal of anatomical similarity. The 1861 discovery of
<I>Archaeopteryx</I>, the "first bird" added fuel to this discussion.
<I>Archaeopteryx</I> has a skeleton that retains a number of
dinosaurian traits such as scales on the neck, teeth in the mouth, a
jointed tail, and grasping fingers on the wings. It also has avian
characteristics such as hollow bones and flight feathers. Many
"dinosaur" specimens have, upon the discovery of feathers, been
reassigned to fossil bird species. The discovery of feathers on some
dinosaurs has further blurred what was once a clear-cut distinction
between birds and dinosaurs. Cladistic analyses have repeatedly shown
that birds and some groups of dinosaurs form a well-defined clade.

Mosasaurs were predators of the Cretaceous seas. Many ammonite
fossils have been found that have tooth marks suggesting mosasaurs
actively sought and ate ammonites. Some paleontologoists believe that
mosasaurs became so successful because they were able to utilize the
role in the marine environment that was opened once the ichthyosaurs
went extinct. Mosasaurs apparently gave birth to live young and
perhaps had some level of parental care for their young. </FONT></P>

to massive mountain building episodes that produced parts of the
Rocky Mountains in the north and the Andes Mountains in the south.
During much of the Cretaceous, North America was split into two
separate land areas by the north-south tending seaway. This led to
the development of two distinct paleofloristic regions: the
<I>Aquilapollenites</I> province in the west and the normapolles
province in the east. The <I>Aquilapollenites</I> province extended
northward through Alaska and Siberia and then southward into eastern
Asia. The normapolles province passed through Greenland and into
northern Europe. With the drop in sea-levels at the end of the

other) regions. India, which had separated from the rest of the

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Among the various hypotheses to explain the
extinction that closed the Mesozoic era were allergies by dinosaurs
to pollen produced by flowering plants, increased radiation levels
that led to male dinosaur sterility, diseases brought by migrating
animals, and a gradual climate deterioration that the dinosaurs were
unable to cope with. The first hypothesis ignores the fact that
flowering plants and dinosaurs had coexisted for over 70 million
years at the time of the mass extinction. Increased radiation levels
would not cause the extinction of many of the plant species, nor do
we know if male dinosaurs carried their gonads outside their bodies.
The migration hypothesis does have some merit. We know, for example,
that introduction of a new animal group to an area will cause
ecologoical realignments, as well as ossibly bring disease to an
area. Sheep in Iceland, for example, were severely affected by a
virus brought along with new sheep from Europe. The icelandic sheep
had no resistance to this virus (although the european newcomers
did). The suggestion that dinosaurs went extinct because they were
unable to cope with a cooling had merit when we viewed all dinosaurs
as little more than large </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#ectotherms"><FONT SIZE="+1">ectothermic</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
lizards. The modern view of dinosaurs suggests they were quite well
adapted to their environments, and although the diversity of
dinosaurs shows a drop approaching the end of the Cretaceous, that
those dinosaurs that existed, such as <I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I> and
<I>Triceratops</I>, were well suited to their environments.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1980, physics Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez (1911
- 1988) with his son, Berkeley geology professorWalter Alvarez (born
in 1940), and their coworkers proposed a wild idea: an asteroid had
hit the earth 65 million years ago and triggered a series oif events
that culminated in the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#mass extinction"><FONT SIZE="+1">mass
extinction</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> that ended the age of
dinosaurs. Their discovery of unusually high levels of the rare metal
iridium at the boundary layer between the Cretaceous and the Tertiary
periods led to a conclusion that the extinction was caused by a 10 km
asteroid. Iridium is a rare metal at the Earth's surface, but is
known to occur at impact sites, and is also thought to occur deep
within the Earth. The major flaw in the hypothesis at that time was
the lack of a suitably large impact structure of the correct age. In
1991 a team of other scientists found evidence of just such a crater
buried off the coast of the villiage of Chicxulub in Yucatan, Mexico.
Consequences of the impact were profound. The immense amounts of
material ejected from the crater into the atmosphere blocked or
reduced sunlight levels, effectively shutting down the process of
photosynthesis that is the basis of all food webs. The vaporization
of rocks at impact contributed sulfur and nitric acids, which had a
severe acid rain effect of vegetation and marine environments.
Shocked quartz grains, usually considered diagnostic of an impact
site (or a nuclear test site), have been found associated with these
deposits. </FONT></P>
