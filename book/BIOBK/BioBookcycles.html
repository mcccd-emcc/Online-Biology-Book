is the sum of all living matter on the Earth. Highly specialized
organisms have adapted to the extreme boundaries of the uppermost
atmosphere and lowermost ocean depths. The biosphere is
interconnected with three other spheres of the physical environment:

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The lithosphere is the solid outer layer of the
Earth's crust, including rocks, sand, and soil. The Earth's
lithosphere is a dynamic area, with processes such as erosion,
earthquakes, and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#plate tectonics"><FONT SIZE="+1">plate

essentially "float" on a semi-molten lower crustal layer. Plate
motion rates range between 2 and 15 centimeters per year. Tectonic
processes have formed new continents, mountain ranges, and moved
existing continents across the surface of the Earth, causing the
evolution and extinction of species from resulting climate and

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The hydrosphere includes all water at or near the
Earth's surface. Water is very important to a number of biological
and geological processes. The hydrologic cycle is the continuous
recycling of water between the oceans and atmosphere. Evaporation is
the movement of water from an ocean or a lake to the atmosphere.

(rainfall or snow) is the movement of water from the atmosphere to
the land or ocean. Water on land can be either surface runoff or
filter through soil to become groundwater.</FONT></P>

surrounds the Earth. Nitrogen and oxygen compose 99% of the modern
atmosphere. The atmosphere becomes progressively thinner with
increasing altitude.</FONT></P>

transfers water from the lithosphere to the atmosphere, where it
precipitates into the hydrosphere. The interface between water and

fresh water in clouds, leaving salts in the ocean. Water vapor cools
and condenses to precipitation over oceans and land. Runoff forms
freshwater lakes, streams, ponds, groundwater, and is held in plants
and transpired. Some water infiltrates the ground, becoming part of
the groundwater, returning very slowly to the oceans. Although the
water cycle, Figure 2, shows water to be a renewable resource, only
about 3% of that water is fresh and suitable for human use. Water may
be polluted or inadequate for human populations concentrated in
specific areas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There is a relationship between the two major

and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cellular respiration"><FONT SIZE="+1">cellular
respiration</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. Cellular respiration releases
carbon dioxide, which is used as a raw material in photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis in turn releases oxygen used in respiration. Animals
and other </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#heterotrophs"><FONT SIZE="+1">heterotrophs</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
depend on green organisms for organic food, energy, and oxygen. In
the carbon cycle, organisms exchange carbon dioxide with the
atmosphere. On land, plants take up carbon dioxide via photosynthesis
and incorporate it into food used by themselves and heterotrophs.
When organisms respire, some of this carbon is returned to the
atmosphere in the molecules of carbon dioxide. In aquatic ecosystems,
carbon dioxide from air combines with water to give carbonic acid,
which breaks down to bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate ions are a source
of carbon for algae. When aquatic organisms respire, they release
carbon dioxide that becomes bicarbonate (HCO<SUB>3</SUB>). The amount
of bicarbonate in water is in equilibrium with amount of carbon
dioxide in air. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Living and dead organisms are reservoirs of carbon
in carbon cycle, shown in Figure 7. More than</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">800 billion tons of carbon are in the world's biota,
mainly in cells of trees.</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">An additional 1,000 to 3,000 billion tons of
carbon occurs in plant and animal remains in the soil. Fossil fuels,

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Two Classes of Countries</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The developed countries are those that
industrialized first, such as the United States, Canada, Japan,
Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and all of Europe. These countries
have twenty-two percent of the world's population, but consume nearly
eighty percent of the energy and resources. Waste and pollution are
also greater in proportion to use of resources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The developing countries have seventy-eight
percent of the population, but use only twenty percent of the Earth's
resources. These countries include most of Africa, South America,
India, and China. Most people in these coluntries have a lifestyle
far below that of the inhabitants of the developed countries. As
developing contries expand their economies, their people will strive
to achieve the lifestyle of consumption and waste that we in
developed countries take for granted. For instance, in China the
bicycle remains the method of transportation for most people, but
more and more motorcycles and cars are owned by the increasing
affluent entrepenuers and government officials. When I visited the
faculty and students at Wuyi University (China) in 1998, only a few
of the faculty had motor bikes. A colleague of mine visited the same
university in the summer of 2002 and reported that almost all faculty
had motor bikes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Industrialization is driven by energy consumption
from coal, petroleum, and natural gas, otherwise known as
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossF.html#fossil fuels"><FONT SIZE="+1">fossil
fuels</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. Fossil fuels formed by
decomposition and alteration of the remains of plants, protists, and
animals over a time span of several million years. These sources are
considered nonrenewable since they are in limited supply in terms of
human-scale time. Oil (petroleum) is the fuel most widely used, both
as starting material for making gasoline and for other products.
Historically coal was the first fossil fuel used in the
European/American Industrial Revolution of the 1800s. Petroleum soon
replaced coal, and has remained the mainstay of the energy fix needed
by industrialized societies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Pollution is any environmental change that
adversely affects the lives and health of living things. Burning
fossil fuels results in hydrocarbons, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur
oxides, and particulates. Automobiles consume one-third of the
world's production of oil and are the chief source of air pollution.
Some scientists estimate there will be four times more automobiles in
the world by 2025. Industrially produced halogens and the use of
nitrogen fertilizers also influence the atmosphere in a negative
manner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Sources of energy that are relatively nonpolluting
exist. However, these nonpolluting energy sources are not as commonly
used as fossil fuels. Solar energy does not add additional heat to
the atmosphere, although the production of solar panels may
contribute to pollution. Solar panels, often mounted on rooftops,
absorb and move rooftop heat into water circulating within the
panels. Photovoltaic (solar) cells produce energy directly from
sunlight, although the cost of this energy is several times what
conventional (fossil) fuel-generated electricity costs.</FONT></P>

hydroelectric dams, asshown in Figure 9. However, most dams would not
be compliant with newer, more strict environmental regulations. The
damming of rivers to generate power (and hold water for irrigation
and other purposes) can lead to local extinctions or declines in
native fish populations. Water that id dammed up no longer freely
flows, placing wetland habitats downstream from the dam at risk. The
numerous dams built along the Salt and Verde Rivers in Phoenx,
Arizona (USA) have led to a reduction of downstream biodiversity as
once perenniel streams now flow only seasonally. Construction of the
Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River in northern Arizona (shown in
Figure 10) has led to vegetaion and other changes inside Grand Canyon
Nartional Park. The Three Gorges Dam being currently built along the
banks of the Yangtze River in China will displace over two million
people, flood areas that have been inhabited for over 10,000 years,
as well as disrupt the breeding patterns of the Yangtze sturgeon.
When complete, this dam will generate enough power every day to light
a city the size of Los Angeles, adding new power to the Chinese
economic expansion.</FONT></P>

parts per million (ppm). Today, it is about 350 ppm. This increase is
due largely to burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.

global temperature would be noticeable. From studies of fossils we
can estimate how long it would naturally take for such rises in
temerature. The effects of human activity on the atmosphere will
accelerate this rise from a span of centuries to just a few decades.
As oceans warm, temperatures in polar regions would likely rise to a
greater degree than other areas. Glaciers would melt and sea levels
would rise due to melting and expansion of warm water. Water
evaporation would increase with increased rainfall along coasts and
dry conditions inland. Droughts would reduce agricultural
productivity and trees would die off. Expansion of forests into
Arctic areas would not likely offset loss of forests in temperate
zones. Coastal agricultural lands and deltas in Bangladesh, India,
and China would be inundated. In China two-thirds of the 1.2 billion
people live in low-lying coastal areas. Many of these areas would be
flooded by rising sea levels. </FONT></P>

fever, and dysentery. Sewage treatment plants use bacteria to break
down organic matter into inorganic nutrients. The treated water can
then be used for various purposes, depending on state and local laws
governing sewage treated water. During the spring of 2000, Los
Angeles made national news because of the city's plans to reintroduce
treated sewage water to the home water supply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Agricultural and industrial wastes present a
number of water pollution problems. Intensive animal farming or the
presence of many septic tanks releases ammonium
(NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>) from wastes. This ammonium is converted
by bacteria to soluble nitrate that moves through the soil to water
supplies. Between 5-10% of all wells in the United States have
nitrate levels higher than the recommended maximum. Industrial wastes
include heavy metals and organochlorides, such as some pesticides.
These are not degraded in nature or in normal sewage treatment, and
accumulate in deltas. When these wastes enter water, they are subject
to biological magnification. Decomposers are unable to break down
these wastes, and they are not excreted. The molecules, therefore,
remain in tissues and are passed up the food chain to the next
consumer. They become more concentrated at each level in the food
chain. Since aquatic food chains have more links, biological
magnification is greater. Where humans are the final consumers, human
milk can contain detectable amounts of DDT and PCBs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Aquifer pollution is an increasingly significant
health threat. Prior to environmental regulations enacted during the
1970s, many industries ran wastewater into a pit from which
pollutants could seep into the ground Much of this material
eventually made its way to the groundwater in various aquifers below
the surface. Wastewater and chemical wastes were also injected into
deep wells. Both practices are being phased out; there are few
alternatives for industry to dispose of wastes, other than to reduce
the volume or develop a long-term containment facility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The oceans are the final recipients of wastes
deposited in rivers and along the coasts. Waste dumping occurs at
sea, and ocean currents sometimes transport both trash and pollutants
back to shore. Solid pollutants cause death of birds, fish, and
marine mammals that mistake them for food and get entangled. Offshore
mining and shipping add pollutants to the oceans. Five million metric
tons of oil a year, over one gram per 100 square meters of ocean
surface, ends up in oceans. Large oil spills kill plankton, fish
larvae, and shellfishes, as well as birds and marine mammals. The
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound leaked 44
million liters of crude oil. During the Gulf War, 120 million liters
were released from damaged onshore storage tanks in the Persian Gulf.
Petroleum is biodegradable; takes a long time because low-nutrient
content does not support bacteria. Some species of fish are in
dramatic decline from combined effects of pollution and overfishing.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1950, 20 % of the world's population lived in
cities. Predictions of this number rising to 60% by 2000 have been
made. The trend of growth of urban areas began with the Industrial
revolution of the 1800s, but greatly accelerated after World War II.
Buidling new housing around new (or enlarging) cities, removes land
from agricultural uses. Change of land use can alter heat
distribution patterns and surface water runoff. Expanded urbanization
also degrades the environment. Estrella Mountain Commmunity College,
my college, was built in 1991 (opened in 1992) in an old cotton
field. When we opened our campus the nearest houses were over one
mile away. New houses and development are now surrounding our once
isolated campus shown in Figure 17.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#extinction"><FONT SIZE="+1">Extinctions</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
occur when environments change too fast.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Local
extinctions can occur, as can mass extinctions: they differ in scale,
scope and the numbers of species involved.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">There have been five environmental changes (mostly
cooling) of global proportions that resulted in the five mass
extinctions in Earth history.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Recovery from
these extinctions took millions of years.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">A
spectacular exception was the large meteorite strike sixty-six
million years ago near the Yucat&aacute;n peninsula in Mexico that
either caused the extinction of dinosaurs and 75% of all marine
species, or was the nail in the coffin of the dinosaurs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There have been several natural mass extinctions
in the history of earth followed by recovery. Human activities that
reduce biodiversity began about 30,000 years ago with development of
social and language skills to apply increasingly better stone tool
technology to trap and kill the largher animals. Hunting contributes
to the estimated extinction of 15,000 to 30,000 species a year. Fish
stocks are being depleted by overfishing. Commercial trade causes
exploitation of tigers, cheetahs, leopards, jaguars, etc. for furs;
sharks for fins; rhinoceros for rhino horn powder; elephants for
tusks for ivory; and cacti for gardeners. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A major cause of extinction is the loss of habitat
to support a species. The habitat for a species may be totally
destroyed through natural events or human activities. Habitats may be
fragmented into small pieces that cannot support the population. By
2010, very little undisturbed rain forest will exist outside of
national parks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Accidental or purposeful introduction of new
species can cause extinction of endemic species. Introduction of
brown tree snake to Guam has resulted in extinction of nine of eleven
native bird species. The carp, an Asian fish that can tolerate
polluted waters, is now more prevalent than our native fish. Kudzu, a
plant native to Asia, has beome a major pest throughout the south.
Water hyacinth escaped from captivity and has become a hazard to
navigation, as well as disrupting the local environment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Global climate change may be so rapid that many
species cannot adjust. Biological magnification of pesticides has
reduced predatory bird populations. Acid deposition is implicated in
the worldwide decline in amphibian populations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Conservation biology is a discipline that brings
together many fields to attempt to solve biodiversity problems. It
attempts to develop practical approaches to preventing extinction of
species and destruction of ecosystems. Most conservation biologists
believe biological diversity is good and each species has a value all
its own. Sustainability is concept that it is possible to meet
economic needs while protecting environment. Some economists argue
that as per capita income increases, environmental degradation first
increases, then decreases as people become affluent enough to begin
to protect the environment.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Development in Tropical Regions</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Human-caused environmental changes and extinctions
are accelerating in the tropics.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">If this pace
continues nearly half all species could be extinct by 2050.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Development in tropical areas causes more extinctions
due to the great diversity found in tropical rain forests (half all
species on Earth).</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Tropical reefs are also
under siege by water pollution, leading to even more
extinctions.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Nearly half the rain forests are
gone already.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">By as early as 2010 (less than
15 years!) all rain forests will be gone if present trends of
exploitation and human population growth continue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Species are not equally likely to suffer
extinction.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Cockroaches hav e been around for
300 million years essentially unchanged and probably will be around
for millions more.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Island species, species
with limited habitats, low reproductive rates, high territory
requirements, susceptibility to pollution, predators, and having
economic value: all make species susceptible to
extinction.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">What Does Extinction Mean to Me?</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We migh ask ourselves, why should we try to save
species from extinction?</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">One answer is that
wildlife is a curiosity for which humans have no need.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Others seek to preserve nature for its own
sake.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">There are some economic reasons to save
species from extinction: food and non-food uses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Approximately 7000 plant species have historically
been used by humans as food.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Today, thirty of
these species provide 95% of all human food.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Just four -wheat, corn, rice, and potatoes- provide
most of the world's food.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Nearly 75,000 edible
plants species exist, many superior in nutrition and quality to the
30 we favor today.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Low genetic diversity,
resulting from centuries of selective inbreeding, make crops
especially susceptible to pests and parasites.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">During the 1970s the U.S. corn crop was almost
completely wiped out by a leaf fungus.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The
corn crop was saved by interbreeding it with a rare species of wild
corn from Mexico.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Genetic engineering may also
offer some hope by facilitating transfer of genes between
species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">This increases the value of wild
strains which can be used as sources for new traits to be introduced
into crops.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At current rates, 25,000 plant species will become
extinct by the year 2000, before we have a chance to study
them.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Gene banks to save seeds, spores and
genetic material have been proposed as a solution.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Currently they contain only a small fraction of all
wild plant species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Hybridization is also a
potential method to improve domesticated animal stocks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many wild plants species provide economically
important products, such as rubber.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Originally
many modern medicines started out as plants used by premodern
societies, such as aspirin.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Forty-seven major
drugs have been produced from flowering plants taken from the rain
forests.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">An estimated 320 valuable drugs
remain undiscovered in the forests Taxol, an extract from the rare
Pacific yew tree (<I>Taxus</I>), is a potent anticancer drug.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Some products, like oils, exotic fruits, and rubber
are known as forest-sustainable resources since the forest does not
have to be cut down to harvest them, and in most cases bring in more
money than the wood from the trees is worth.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Ecosystems as Environmental Support
Systems</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Species diversity is important to preserve because
ecosystems are composed of species and provide us with so many of
life's essentials, dismantle them and we have a real big
problem:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Conferences in 1992 and 1994 resulted in binding
international treaties to control management of finite resources and
population growth along with the resulting human impact on the
biosphere. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Identification, Description, and Research on
Value of Species</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">One of the first steps is to measure how much
biodiversity there is.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Diversity can be
measured at different levels: genetic diversity, species diversity,
and ecosystem diversity.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Only 1.7 million
species have been described, estimates place the total number of
species at 100,000,000.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Biologist E.O. Wilson
has estimated that it would take the life's work on 25,000
specialists to completely study and describe the mostly undescribed
tropical species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">There are currently only
1500 specialists in tropical biology.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Establishment of Preserves</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It is essential to preserve the habitat of
endangered species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Once a species habitat has
been destroyed, it is difficult to successfully reestablish the
species; no ecosystem has ever been completely rebuilt.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Preserves are well established in Africa, Asia, and
the developed countries, although they are not well established in
Central and South America.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Only 1% of the
Earth's land surface has been set aside as preserves.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Development of Laws and Regulations to Protect
Endangered Species</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Poachers are difficult to catch and punish,
especially in under developed countries.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">In
1975 a treaty made it illegal to trade or sell products from
endangered species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The 1989 ban on sale of
elephant ivory has been successful in slowing the decline in elephant
populations.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Endangered Species Act</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Nearly 4000 species in the U.S. are in danger of
extinction by the year 2000.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The Endangered
Species Act of 1973 directs governmental agencies to maintain a list
of threatened or endangered species.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The Act
has been controversial and was recently challenged by the
Republican's Contract with America.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The
spotted owl became a major issue in the 1992 Presidential
election.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Most species on the list are closer
to extinction now than when they were put on the list.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Captive Breeding </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">One last resort is to establish breeding programs
in captivity.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Many species do not do well in
such programs, so alternatives like gene banks must be tried.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Breeding programs are costly and the young from such
programs cannot be released into the wild, even if their habitat
still remains.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Reduction of the Socioeconomic Causes of
Extinction</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Basic social and economic issues that drive
explosive population growth and increased exploitation of natural
areas must be addressed.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Estimate predict a
doubling of the 5.4 billion human population by 2050, most of that
growth is expected in developing countries.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Slowing such growth will take decades at best.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Removing economic incentives that cause many species
extinctions is a more immediate measure.</FONT></P>
