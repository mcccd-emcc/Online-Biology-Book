<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A common abnormality is caused by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#nondisjunction"><FONT SIZE="+1">nondisjunction</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
the failure of replicated chromosomes to segregate during Anaphase
II. A gamete lacking a chromosome cannot produce a viable embryo.
Occasionally a gamete with n+1 chromosomes can produce a viable
embryo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In humans, nondisjunction is most often associated
with the 21st chromosome, producing a disease known as Down's
syndrome (also referred to as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#trisomy"><FONT SIZE="+1">trisomy</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
21). Sufferers of Down's syndrome suffer mild to severe mental
retardation, short stocky body type, large tongue leading to speech
difficulties, and (in those who survive into middle-age), a
propensity to develop Alzheimer's Disease. Ninety-five percent of
Down's cases result from nondisjunction of chromosome 21. Occasional
cases result from a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#translocation"><FONT SIZE="+1">translocation</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
in the chromosomes of one parent. Remember that a translocation
occurs when one chromosome (or a fragment) is transferred to a
non-homologous chromosome. The incidence of Down's Syndrome increases
with age of the mother, although 25% of the cases result from an
extra chromosome from the father. Click </FONT><A HREF="down's.gif"><FONT SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
to view a drawing (from Bioweb) of a karyotype of Down's
syndrome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Sex-chromosome abnormalities may also be caused by
nondisjunction of one or more sex chromosomes. Any combination (up to
XXXXY) produces maleness. Males with more than one X are usually
underdeveloped and sterile. XXX and XO women are known, although in
most cases they are sterile. What meiotic difficulties might a person
with Down's syndrome or extra sex-chromosomes face?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The first Mendelian trait in humans was described
in 1905 (brachydactly) by Dr. Farabee (no relation to your author).
Now more than 3500 human genetic traits are known.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#albinism"><FONT SIZE="+1">Albinism</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
the lack of pigmentation in skin, hair, and eyes, is also a Mendelian
human trait. Homozygous recessive (aa) individuals make no pigments,
and so have face, hair, and eyes that are white to yellow. For
heterozygous parents with normal pigmentation (Aa), two different
types of gametes may be produced: A or a. From such a cross 1/4 of
the children could be albinos. The brown pigment </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#melanin"><FONT SIZE="+1">melanin</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
cannot be made by albinos. Several mutations may cause albinism: 1)
the lack of one or another enzyme along the melanin-producing
pathway; or 2) the inability of the enzyme to enter the pigment cells
and convert the amino acid tyrosine into melanin. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Phenylketonuria (PKU) is recessively inherited
disorder whose sufferers lack the ability to synthesize an enzyme to
convert the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine Individuals
homozygous recessive for this allele have a buildup of phenylalanine
and abnormal breakdown products in the urine and blood. The breakdown
products can be harmful to developing nervous systems and lead to
mental retardation. 1 in 15,000 infants suffers from this problem.
PKU homozygotes are now routinely tested for in most states. If you
look closely at a product containing Nutra-sweet artificial
sweetener, you will see a warning to PKU sufferers since
phenylalanine is one of the amino acids in the sweetener. PKU
sufferers are placed on a diet low in phenylalanine, enough for
metabolic needs but not enough to cause the buildup of harmful
intermediates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Tay-Sachs Disease is an autosomal recessive
resulting in degeneration of the nervous system. Symptoms manifest
after birth. Children homozygous recessive for this allele rarely
survive past five years of age. Sufferers lack the ability to make
the enzyme N-acetyl-hexosaminidase, which breaks down the GM2
ganglioside lipid. This lipid accumulates in </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#lysosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">lysosomes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
in brain cells, eventually killing the brain cells. Although rare in
the general population (1 in 300,000 births), it was (until recently)
higher (1 in 3600 births) among Jews of eastern central European
descent. One in 28 American Jews is thought to be a carrier, since
90% of the American Jewish population emigrated from those areas in
Europe. Most Tay-Sachs babies born in the US are born to non-Jewish
parents, who did not undergo testing programs that most US Jewish
prospective parents had.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sickle cell anemia"><FONT SIZE="+1">Sickle-cell
anemia</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is an autosomal recessive we have
discussed in other sections. Nine-percent of US blacks are
heterozygous, while 0.2% are homozygous recessive. The recessive
allele causes a single amino acid substitution in the beta chains of

When oxygen concentration is low, sickling of cells occurs.
Heterozygotes make enough "good beta-chain hemoglobin" that they do
not suffer as long as oxygen concentrations remain high, such as at
sea-level.</FONT></P>

(by definition) more commonly expressed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Achondroplastic dwarfism occurs, even though
sufferers have reduced fertility. </FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#Huntington disease"><FONT SIZE="+1">Huntington's
disease</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (also referred to as Woody
Guthrie's disease, after the folk singer who died in the 1960s) is an
autosomal dominant resulting in progressive destruction of brain
cells. If a parent has the disease, 50% of the children will have it
(unless that parent was homozygous dominant, in which case all
children would have the disease). The disease usually does not
manifest until after age 30, although some instances of early onset
phenomenon are reported among individuals in their twenties.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Polydactly is the presence of a sixth digit. In
modern times the extra finger has been cut off at birth and
individuals do not know they carry this trait. One of the wives of
Henry VIII had an extra finger. In certain southern families the
trait is also more common. The extra digit is rarely functional and
definitely causes problems buying gloves, let alone fitting them on
during a murder trial. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Color blindness afflicts 8% of males and 0.04 % of
human females. Color perception depends on three genes, each
producing chemicals sensitive to different parts of the visible light
spectrum. Red and green detecting genes are on the X-chromosome,
while the blue detection is on an autosome. </FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hemophilia"><FONT SIZE="+1">Hemophilia</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors
in blood are involved in clotting. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal
Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A, the most common form.
Normal Factor VIII can be supplied at a high dollar and health risk
cost, although the development of biotechnologically engineered
Factor VIII produced by bacteria lessens the health risk. England's
Queen Victoria was a carrier for this disease. The allele was passed
to two of her daughters and one son. Since royal families in Europe
commonly intermarried, the allele spread, and may have contributed to
the downfall of the Russian monarchy (Czar Nicholas' son Alexei
suffered from hemophilia A inherited from his mother who carried
Victoria's genetic secret).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Muscular dystrophy is a term encompassing a
variety of muscle wasting diseases. The most common type, Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), affects cardiac and skeletal muscle, as
well as some mental functions. DMD is an X-linked recessive occurring
in 1 in 3500 newborns. Most sufferers die before their 20th birthday.
In 1987, Louis Kunkel claimed to have isolated a protein,
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#dystrophin "><FONT SIZE="+1">dystrophin</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
present in normal individuals (about 0.002 % of their muscle protein)
but absent in two individuals with DMD. The lack of dystrophin is
accompanied with a condition of muscle hardening known as fibrosis,
which restricts blood supply to the muscle which then die. The gene
technologies discussed in an earlier chapter have been employed to
sequence and clone the dystrophin gene, which is the largest known
human gene (some 2-3 million base pairs), with 60 exons and many
large introns.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#restriction enzymes"><FONT SIZE="+1">Restriction
enzymes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, such as <I>Hpa </I>I were used in
a study on sickle-cell anemia. The probe hybridized in normal
hemoglobin with two fragments 7000 or 7600 nucleotides long.
Sickle-cell hemoglobin had hybridization with a 13,000 nucleotide
single sequence. A similar result has been obtained from
amniocentesis studies, providing a tool to screen fetus and adult for
sickle-cell. The markers where hybridization occurred are referred to
as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#restriction fragment length pol"><FONT SIZE="+1">RFLPs
(restriction-fragment-length
polymorphisms)</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. The longer fragment in
sickle-cell individuals is interpreted as evidence of a mutation in
the recognition sequence. Two nucleotide sequences close together on
the same DNA molecule tend to stay together. In the sickle-cell DNA
the beta-chain hemoglobin gene has become linked with another gene
that somehow alters the recognition sequence at which <I>Hpa </I>I
hybridizes. Heterozygotes will have both long and short fragments,
while a single type (short or long) will occur in homozygous dominant
and recessive, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Huntington's disease was studied by James F.
Gusella and his research team, who used RFLPs to identify a marker.
Testing a large library of human DNA fragments, Gusella et al. found
the needle in the haystack. The enzyme used was <I>Hind </I>III. Four
fragments have been identified in an American family that has members
suffering from the disease. The presence of fragment A has been
identified in individuals who suffer from (or will suffer from)
Huntington's. Pattern A occurs in 60 percent of the population, as
well as the Huntington's sufferers. A Venezuelan family of 3000
members is descended from a German sailor who had Huntington's. This
family had a strong correlation between Fragment C and the disease.
Pattern C is much less common among the general population in this
country. Many individuals do not wish to know if they will develop
this disease; Woody Guthrie's children have chosen not to be
tested.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cystic fibrosis"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cystic
fibrosis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (CF) has also been studied with
RFLP technology. CF is the most common genetic disease in
Caucasians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hemophiliacs suffer from defective Factor VIII,
which can be detected in fetuses 20 weeks old. A more accurate test,
which can also be administered earlier during pregnancy, involves the
use of a radioactive probe (36 nucleotide RNA fragment) which
hybridizes restriction fragments. The gene for hemophilia is 186,000
base pairs, and has 26 </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#exon"><FONT SIZE="+1">exons</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
separated by 25 </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossI.html#intron"><FONT SIZE="+1">introns</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Mutations in the gene can be detected by RFLPs. This technology has
also been used to detect the single base-pair difference between
normal and mutated beta-chains, a screen for sickle-cell anemia. A
DNA probe has been developed that hybridizes with the gene for
dystrophin. The previous screening for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
was a sex screen, with option to abort a male. The new technique
allows differentiation between the healthy and diseased male fetus,
so parents have more information with which to make an informed
choice (if they chose). The hybridization only occurs if the normal
dystrophin gene is present, no hybridization occurs in the DMD
sufferer.</FONT></P>
