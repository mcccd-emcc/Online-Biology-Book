promote stem elongation, inhibit growth of lateral buds (maintains
apical dominance). They are produced in the stem, buds, and root
tips. Example: Indole Acetic Acid (IA). Auxin is a plant hormone
produced in the stem tip that promotes cell elongation. Auxin moves
to the darker side of the plant, causing the cells there to grow
larger than corresponding cells on the lighter side of the plant.
This produces a curving of the plant stem tip toward the light, a

as sufficient auxin is produced by the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#apical meristem"><FONT SIZE="+1">apical

If the apex of the shoot is removed (by a browsing animal or a
scientist), the auxin is no longer produced. This will cause the
lateral buds to break their dormancy and begin to grow. In effect,
the plant becomes bushier. When a gardener trims a hedge, they are
applying apical dominance. </FONT></P>
