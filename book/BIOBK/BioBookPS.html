Likewise, oxygen produced during photosynthesis can only pass out of
the leaf through the opened stomata. Unfortunately for the plant,
while these gases are moving between the inside and outside of the
leaf, a great deal water is also lost. Cottonwood trees, for example,
will lose 100 gallons of water per hour during hot desert days.

properties of light include the bending of the wave path when passing
from one material (medium) into another (i.e. the prism, rainbows,
pencil in a glass-of-water, etc.). The particle properties are
demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. Zinc exposed to ultraviolet
light becomes positively charged because light energy forces
electrons from the zinc. These electrons can create an electrical
current. Sodium, potassium and selenium have critical wavelengths in
the visible light range. The critical wavelength is the maximum
wavelength of light (visible or invisible) that creates a
photoelectric effect. </FONT><A NAME=Chlorophyll></A></P>

Shorter wavelengths (with more energy) do not penetrate much below 5
meters deep in sea water. The ability to absorb some energy from the

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The action spectrum of photosynthesis is the
relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of light at
generating electrons. If a pigment absorbs light energy, one of three
things will occur. Energy is dissipated as heat. The energy may be
emitted immediately as a longer wavelength, a phenomenon known as
fluorescence. Energy may trigger a chemical reaction, as in
photosynthesis. Chlorophyll only triggers a chemical reaction when it
is associated with proteins embedded in a membrane (as in a
chloroplast) or the membrane infoldings found in photosynthetic
prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria and prochlorobacteria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Photosynthesis is a two stage process. The first
process is the Light Dependent Process (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#light reactions"><FONT SIZE="+1">Light

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the Light Dependent Processes (Light Reactions)
light strikes chlorophyll a in such a way as to excite electrons to a

Water is split in the process, releasing oxygen as a by-product of
the reaction. The ATP and NADPH are used to make C-C bonds in the
Light Independent Process (Dark Reactions).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the Light Independent Process, carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere (or water for aquatic/marine organisms) is
captured and modified by the addition of Hydrogen to form
carbohydrates (general formula of carbohydrates is
&#91;CH<SUB>2</SUB>O&#93;<SUB>n</SUB>). The incorporation of carbon
dioxide into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The
energy for this comes from the first phase of the photosynthetic
process. Living systems cannot directly utilize light energy, but
can, through a complicated series of reactions, convert it into C-C
bond energy that can be released by glycolysis and other metabolic
processes.</FONT></P>

are arrangements of chlorophyll and other pigments packed into
thylakoids. Many Prokaryotes have only one photosystem, Photosystem
II (so numbered because, while it was most likely the first to
evolve, it was the second one discovered). Eukaryotes have
Photosystem II plus Photosystem I. Photosystem I uses chlorophyll a,
in the form referred to as P700. Photosystem II uses a form of
chlorophyll a known as P680. Both "active" forms of chlorophyll a
function in photosynthesis due to their association with proteins in
the thylakoid membrane.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#phosphorylation"><FONT SIZE="+1">Photophosphorylation</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is the process of converting energy from a light-excited electron
into the pyrophosphate bond of an ADP molecule. This occurs when the
electrons from water are excited by the light in the presence of
P680. The energy transfer is similar to the chemiosmotic electron
transport occurring in the mitochondria. Light energy causes the
removal of an electron from a molecule of P680 that is part of
Photosystem II. The P680 requires an electron, which is taken from a
water molecule, breaking the water into H<SUP>+</SUP> ions and
O<SUP>-2</SUP> ions. These O<SUP>-2</SUP> ions combine to form the
diatomic O<SUB>2</SUB> that is released. The electron is "boosted" to
a higher energy state and attached to a primary electron acceptor,
which begins a series of redox reactions, passing the electron
through a series of electron carriers, eventually attaching it to a
molecule in Photosystem I. Light acts on a molecule of P700 in
Photosystem I, causing an electron to be "boosted" to a still higher
potential. The electron is attached to a different primary electron
acceptor (that is a different molecule from the one associated with
Photosystem II). The electron is passed again through a series of
redox reactions, eventually being attached to NADP<SUP>+</SUP> and
H<SUP>+</SUP> to form NADPH, an energy carrier needed in the Light
Independent Reaction. The electron from Photosystem II replaces the
excited electron in the P700 molecule. There is thus a continuous
flow of electrons from water to NADPH. This energy is used in Carbon
Fixation. Cyclic Electron Flow occurs in some eukaryotes and
primitive photosynthetic bacteria. No NADPH is produced, only ATP.
This occurs when cells may require additional ATP, or when there is
no NADP<SUP>+</SUP> to reduce to NADPH. In Photosystem II, the
pumping to H ions into the thylakoid and the conversion of ADP + P
into ATP is driven by electron gradients established in the thylakoid
membrane.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Some plants have developed a preliminary step to
the Calvin Cycle (which is also referred to as a C-3 pathway), this
preamble step is known as C-4. While most C-fixation begins with
RuBP, C-4 begins with a new molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a
3-C chemical that is converted into oxaloacetic acid (OAA, a 4-C
chemical) when carbon dioxide is combined with PEP. The OAA is
converted to Malic Acid and then transported from the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#mesophyll"><FONT SIZE="+1">mesophyll</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
cell into the bundle-sheath cell, where OAA is broken down into PEP
plus carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide then enters the Calvin Cycle,
with PEP returning to the mesophyll cell. The resulting sugars are
now adjacent to the leaf veins and can readily be transported
throughout the plant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The capture of carbon dioxide by PEP is mediated
by the enzyme PEP carboxylase, which has a stronger affinity for
carbon dioxide than does RuBP carboxylase When carbon dioxide levels
decline below the threshold for RuBP carboxylase, RuBP is catalyzed
with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. The product of that reaction
forms glycolic acid, a chemical that can be broken down by
photorespiration, producing neither NADH nor ATP, in effect
dismantling the Calvin Cycle. C-4 plants, which often grow close
together, have had to adjust to decreased levels of carbon dioxide by
artificially raising the carbon dioxide concentration in certain
cells to prevent photorespiration. C-4 plants evolved in the tropics
and are adapted to higher temperatures than are the C-3 plants found
at higher latitudes. Common C-4 plants include crabgrass, corn, and
sugar cane. Note that OAA and Malic Acid also have functions in other
processes, thus the chemicals would have been present in all plants,
leading scientists to hypothesize that C-4 mechanisms evolved several
times independently in response to a similar environmental condition,
a type of evolution known as convergent evolution.</FONT></P>

removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and oceans by fixing it
into organic chemicals. Plants also produce some carbon dioxide by
their respiration, but this is quickly used by photosynthesis. Plants
also convert energy from light into chemical energy of C-C covalent
bonds. Animals are carbon dioxide producers that derive their energy
from carbohydrates and other chemicals produced by plants by the
process of photosynthesis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The balance between the plant carbon dioxide
removal and animal carbon dioxide generation is equalized also by the
formation of carbonates in the oceans. This removes excess carbon
dioxide from the air and water (both of which are in equilibrium with
regard to carbon dioxide). Fossil fuels, such as petroleum and coal,
as well as more recent fuels such as peat and wood generate carbon
dioxide when burned. Fossil fuels are formed ultimately by organic
processes, and represent also a tremendous carbon sink. Human
activity has greatly increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in
air. This increase has led to global warming, an increase in
temperatures around the world, the Greenhouse Effect. The increase in
carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the air has also led to
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#acid rain"><FONT SIZE="+1">acid
rain</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, where water falls through polluted
air and chemically combines with carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and
sulfur oxides, producing rainfall with pH as low as 4. This results
in fish kills and changes in soil pH which can alter the natural
vegetation and uses of the land. The Global Warming problem can lead
to melting of the ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica, raising
sea-level as much as 120 meters. Changes in sea-level and temperature
would affect climate changes, altering belts of grain production and
rainfall patterns.</FONT></P>
