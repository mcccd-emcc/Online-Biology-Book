<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Between 1884 (the year Mendel died) and 1888
details of mitosis and meiosis were reported, the cell nucleus was
identified as the location of the genetic material, and "qualities"
were even proposed to be transmitted on chromosomes to daughter cells
at mitosis. In 1903 Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri formally
proposed that </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#chromosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">chromosomes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
contain the genes. The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#chromosome theory of inheritanc"><FONT SIZE="+1">Chromosome
Theory of Inheritance</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is one of the
foundations of genetics and explains the physical reality of Mendel's
principles of inheritance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The location of many genes (Mendel's factors) was
determined by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his coworkers in the early
1900's. Morgan's experimental organism was the fruit fly
(<I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>). Fruit flies are ideal organisms for
genetics, having a small size, ease of care, susceptibility to
mutations, and short (7-9 day) generation time. The role of
chromosomes in determination of sex was deduced by Morgan from work
on fruit flies.</FONT></P>

</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossJK.html#karyotype"><FONT SIZE="+1">karyotype</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
can be made by cutting and arranging photomicrographs of the
homologous chromosomes thus revealed at Metaphase I. Two types of
chromosome pairs occur. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#autosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">Autosomes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
resemble each other in size and placement of the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#centromere"><FONT SIZE="+1">centromere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
for example pairs of chromosome 21 are the same size, while pairs of
chromosome 9 are of a different size from pair 21. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sex chromosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">Sex
chromosomes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> may differ in their size,
depending on the species of the organism they are from. In humans and
<I>Drosophila</I>, males have a smaller sex chromosome, termed the Y,
and a larger one, termed the X. Males are thus XY, and are termed
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#heterogametic sex "><FONT SIZE="+1">heterogametic</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Females are XX, and are termed homogametic. In grasshoppers, which
Sutton studied in discovering chromosomes, there is no Y, only the X
chromosome in males. Females are XX, while males are denoted as XO.
Other organisms (notably birds, moths and butterflies) have males
homogametic and females heterogametic. Males (if heterogametic)
contribute either an X or Y to the offspring, while females
contribute either X. The male thus determines the sex of the
offspring. Remember that in meiosis, each chromosome is replicated
and one copy sent to each gamete.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Morgan discovered a mutant eye color and attempted
to use this mutant as a recessive to duplicate Mendel's results. He
failed, instead of achieving a 3:1 F2 ratio the ratio was closer to
4:1 (red to white). Most </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#mutation"><FONT SIZE="+1">mutations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
are usually recessive, thus the appearance of the white mutant
presented Morgan a chance to test Mendel's ratios on animals. The F1
generation also had no white eyed females. Morgan hypothesized that
the gene for eye color was only on the X chromosome, specifically in
that region of the X that had no corresponding region on the Y. White
eyed fruit flies were also more likely to die prior to adulthood,
thus explaining the altered ratios. Normally eyes are red, but a
variant (white) eyed was detected and used in genetic study. Cross a
homozygous white eyed male with a homozygous red eyed female, and all
the offspring have red eyes. Red is dominant over white. However,
cross a homozygous white eyed female with a red eyed male, and the
unexpected results show all the males have white eyes and all the
females red eyes. This can be explained if the eye color gene is on
the X chromosome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Explanation</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">If the gene for eye color is on the X chromosome,
the red eyed male in the second cross will pass his red eyed X to
only his daughters, who in turn received only a recessive
white-carrying X from their mother. Thus all females had red eyes
like their father. Since the male fruit fly passes only the Y to his
sons, their eye color is determined entirely by the single X
chromosome they receive from their mother (in this case white). Thus
all the males in the second cross were white eyed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">These experiments introduced the concept of
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sex linkage"><FONT SIZE="+1">sex-linkage</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
the occurrence of genes on that part of the X that lack a
corresponding location on the Y. Sex-linked recessives (such as white
eyes in fruit flies, </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hemophilia"><FONT SIZE="+1">hemophilia</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
baldness, and colorblindness in humans) occur more commonly in males,

an intermediate phenotype, the heterozygotes express both homozygous

Codominant alleles are both expressed. Heterozygotes for codominant

both A and B antigens. Since neither A nor B is dominant over the

codominant.</FONT></P>

happen if true blending had occurred (blending cannot explain traits
such as red or white skipping a generation and pink flowers crossed
with pink flowers should produce ONLY pink flowers). </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Multiple alleles</FONT></H4></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many genes have more than two alleles (even though
any one diploid individual can only have at most two alleles for any
gene), such as the ABO blood groups in humans, which are an example
of multiple alleles. Multiple alleles result from different mutations
of the same gene. Coat color in rabbits is determined by four
alleles. Human ABO blood types are determined by alleles A, B, and O.
A and B are codominants which are both dominant over O. The only
possible genotype for a type O person is OO. Type A people have
either AA or AO genotypes. Type B people have either BB or BO
genotypes. Type AB have only the AB (heterozygous) genotype. The A
and B alleles of gene I produce slightly different glycoproteins
(antigens) that are on the surface of each cell. Homozygous A
individuals have only the A antigen, homozygous B individuals have
only the B antigen, homozygous O individuals produce neither antigen,
while a fourth phenotype (AB) produces both A and B antigens.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">While one gene may make only one protein, the
effects of those proteins usually interact (for example widow's peak
may be masked by expression of the baldness gene). Novel phenotypes
often result from the interactions of two genes, as in the case of
the comb in chickens. The single comb is produced only by the rrpp
genotype. Rose comb (b) results from R_pp. (_ can be either R or r).
Pea comb (c) results from rrP_. Walnut comb, a novel phenotype, is
produced when the genotype has at least one dominant of each gene
(R_P_).</FONT></P>

is the term applied when one gene interferes with the expression of
another (as in the baldness/widow's peak mentioned earlier). Bateson
reported a different phenotypic ratio in sweet pea than could be
explained by simple Mendelian inheritance. This ratio is 9:7 instead
of the 9:3:3:1 one would expect of a dihybrid cross between
heterozygotes. Of the two genes (C and P), when either is homozygous
recessive (cc or pp) that gene is epistatic to (or hides) the other.
To get purple flowers one must have both C and P alleles
present.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Phenotypes are always affected by their
environment. In buttercup (<I>Ranunculus peltatus</I>), leaves below
water-level are finely divided and those above water-level are broad,
floating, photosynthetic leaf-like leaves. Siamese cats are darker on
their extremities, due to temperature effects on phenotypic
expression. Expression of phenotype is a result of interaction
between genes and environment. Siamese cats and Himalayan rabbits
both animals have dark colored fur on their extremities. This is
caused by an allele that controls pigment production being able only
to function at the lower temperatures of those extremities.
Environment determines the phenotypic pattern of
expression.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#polygenic inheritance"><FONT SIZE="+1">Polygenic
inheritance</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is a pattern responsible for
many features that seem simple on the surface. Many traits such as
height, shape, weight, color, and metabolic rate are governed by the
cumulative effects of many genes. Polygenic traits are not expressed
as absolute or discrete characters, as was the case with Mendel's pea
plant traits. Instead, polygenic traits are recognizable by their
expression as a gradation of small differences (a continuous
variation). The results form a bell shaped curve, with a mean value
and extremes in either direction.</FONT></P>

If you line up the entire class a continuum of variation is evident,
with an average height and extremes in variation (very short

enhanced&#93;). Traits showing continuous variation are usually
controlled by the additive effects of two or more separate gene
pairs. This is an example of polygenic inheritance. The inheritance

in Morgan's lab, postulated that crossing-over would be less common

it should be possible to plot the sequence of genes along a fruit fly
chromosome by using crossing-over frequencies. Distances on gene maps
