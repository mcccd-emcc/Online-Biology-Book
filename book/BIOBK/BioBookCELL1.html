with the most acceptance is the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#big bang theory"><FONT SIZE="+1">Big

the Universe existed in a cosmic egg (smaller than the size of a

discoveries from the Space Telescope and other devices suggest this

includes: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1">1) <B>The Red Shift</B>: when
   stars/galaxies are moving away from us the energy they emit is
   shifted to the red side of the visible-light spectrum. Those
   moving towards us are shifted to the violet side. This shift is an
   example of the Doppler effect. Similar effects are observed when
   listening to a train whistle-- it will sound higher (shorter
   wavelengths) approaching and lower (longer wavelengths) as it
   moves away. Likewise red wavelengths are longer than violet ones.
   Most galaxies appear to be moving away from ours. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Soon after the Big Bang the major forces (such as
gravity, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, etc.)
differentiated. While in the cosmic egg, scientists think that matter
and energy as we understand them did not exist, but rather they
formed soon after the bang. After 10 million to 1 billion years the
universe became clumpy, with matter beginning to accumulate into
solar systems. One of those solar systems, ours, began to form
approximately 5 billion years ago, with a large "protostar" (that
became our sun) in the center. The planets were in orbits some
distance from the star, their increasing gravitational fields
sweeping stray debris into larger and larger planetesimals that
eventually formed planets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The processes of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#radioactive decay"><FONT SIZE="+1">radioactive
decay</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> and heat generated by the impact of
planetesimals heated the Earth, which then began to differentiate
into a "cooled" outer cooled crust (of silicon, oxygen and other
relatively light elements) and increasingly hotter inner areas
(composed of the heavier and denser elements such as iron and
nickel). Impact (asteroid, comet, planetismals) and the beginnings of
volcanism released water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and
other gases into a developing atmosphere. Sometime "soon" after this,
life on Earth began. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Where did life originate and
how?</B></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Extra-terrestrial</B>: In 1969, a meteorite
(left-over bits from the origin of the solar system) landed near
Allende, Mexico. The Allende Meteorite (and others of its sort) have
been analyzed and found to contain </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#amino acids"><FONT SIZE="+1">amino

one of the four organic molecule groups basic to all life. The idea
of panspermia hypothesized that life originated out in space and came
to Earth inside a meteorite. Recently, this idea has been revived as
Cosmic Ancestry. The amino acids recovered from meteorites are in a
group known as exotics: they do not occur in the chemical systems of
living things. The ET theory is now not considered by most scientists
to be correct, although the August 1996 discovery of the Martian
meteorite and its possible fossils have revived thought of life
elsewhere in the Solar System.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Supernatural</B>: Since science is an attempt
to measure and study the natural world, this theory is outside
science (at least our current understanding of science). Science
classes deal with science, and this idea is in the category of
not-science. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Organic Chemical Evolution</B>: Until the
mid-1800's scientists thought organic chemicals (those with a C-C
skeleton) could only form by the actions of living things. A French
scientist heated crystals of a mineral (a mineral is by definition

chemical) when they cooled. Russian scientist and academecian

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The proximity of the Earth to the sun, the make-up
of the Earth's crust (silicate mixtures, presence of water, etc.) and
the size of the Earth suggest we may be unique in our own solar
system, at least. Mars is smaller, farther from the sun, has a lower
gravitational field (which would keep the atmosphere from escaping
into space) and does show evidence of running water sometime in its
past. If life did start on Mars, however, there appears to be no life
(as we know it) today. Venus, the second planet, is closer to the
sun, and appears similar to Earth in many respects. Carbon dioxide
build-up has resulted in a "greenhouse planet" with strong storms and
strongly acidic rain. Of all planets in the solar system, Venus is
most likely to have some form of carbon-based life. The outer planets
are as yet too poorly understood, although it seems unlikely that
Jupiter or Saturn harbor life as we know it. Like Goldilocks would
say "Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, the Earth is just
right!"</FONT></P>

inconclusive at best. The purported bacteria are much smaller than
any known bacteria on Earth, were not hollow, and most could possibly
have been mineral in origin. However, many scientists consider that
the chemistry of life appears to have been established on Mars.
Search for martian life (or its remains) continues. </FONT></P>

early ecosystems prior to the development of an ozone layer that

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Microscopes are important tools for studying
cellular structures. In this class we will use light microscopes for
our laboratory observations. Your text will also show light
photomicrographs (pictures taken with a light microscope) and
electron micrographs (pictures taken with an electron microscope).
There are many terms and concepts which will help you in maximizing
your study of microscopy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">There are many different
types of microscopes used in studying biology. These include the
light microscopes (dissecting, compound brightfield, and compound
phase-contrast), electron microscopes (transmission and scanning),
and atomic force microscope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">The microscope is an
important tool used by biologists to magnify small objects. There are
several concepts fundamental to microscopy.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Magnification</B>
   is the ratio of enlargement (or eduction) between the specimen and
   its image (either printed photograph or the virtual image seen
   through the eyepiece). To calculate magnification we multiply the
   power of each lens through which the light from the specimen
   passes, indicating that product as GGGX, where GGG is the product.
   For example: if the light passes through two,lenses (an objective
   lens and an ocular lens) we multiply the 10X ocular value by the
   value of the objective lens (say it is 4X): 10 X 4=40, or 40X
   magnification.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Resolution</B> is the
   ability to distinguish between two objects (or points). The closer
   the two objects are, the easier it is to distinguish recognize the
   distance between them. What microscopes do is to bring small
   objects "closer" to the observer by increasing the magnification
   of the sample. Since the sample is the same distance from the
   viewer, a "virtual image" is formed as the light (or electron
   beam) passes through the magnifying lenses. Objects such as a
   human hair appear smooth (and feel smooth) when viewed with the
   unaided or naked) eye. However, put a hair under a microscope and
   it takes on a VERY different look!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Working distance</B>
   is the distance between the specimen and the magnifying
   lens.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times"><B>Depth of field</B> is a measure
   of the amount of a specimen that can be in focus.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Magnification and resolution are terms used
frequently in the study of cell biology, often without an accurate
definition of their meanings. Magnification is a ratio of the
enlargement (or reduction) of an image (drawing or photomicrograph),
usually expressed as X1, X1/2, X430, X1000, etc. Resolution is the
ability to distinguish between two points. Generally resolution
increases with magnification, although there does come a point of
diminishing returns where you increase magnification beyond added
resolution gain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Scientists employ the metric system
to measure the size and volume of specimens. The basic unit of length
is the meter (slightly over 1 yard). Prefixes are added to the
"meter" to indicate multiple meters (<U>kilo</U>meter) or fractional
meters (<U>milli</U>meter). Below are the values of some of the
prefixes used in the metric system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">kilo = one thousand of the basic
unit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">meter = basic unit of
length</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">centi = one hundreth (1/100) of the
basic unit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">milli = one thousandth (1/1000) of
the basic unit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">micro = one millionth (1/1,000,000)
of the basic unit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">nano = one billionth
(1/1,000,000,000) of the basic unit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">The basic unit of length is the meter
(m), and of volume it is the liter (l). The gram (g). Prefixes listed
above can be applied to all of these basic units, abbreviated as km,
kg, ml, mg, nm....etc. The Greek letter micron (&#181;) is applied to
small measurements (thoud\sandths of a millimeter), producing the
micrometer (symbolized as &#181;m).</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">
Measurements in microscopy are usually expressed in the metric
system. General units you will encounter in your continuing biology
careers include micrometer (&#181;m, 10<SUP>-6</SUP>m), nanometer
(nm, 10<SUP>-9</SUP>m), and angstrom (&Aring;,
10<SUP>-10</SUP>m).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Light microscopes were the first to be developed,
and still the most commonly used ones. The best resolution of light
microscopes (LM) is 0.2 &#181;m. Magnification of LMs is generally
limited by the properties of the glass used to make microscope lenses
and the physical properties of their light sources. The generally
accepted maximum magnifications in biological uses are between 1000X
and 1250X. Calculation of LM magnification is done by multiplying
objective value by eyepiece value.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">To view relatively large objects at
lower magnifications we utilize the dissecting microscope (shown in
Figure 7). Common uses of this microscope include examination of
prepared microscope slides at low magnification, dissection (hence
the name) of flowers or animal organs, and examinations of the
surface of objects such as pennies and five dollar
bills.</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Magnification on the dissecting
microscope is calculated by multiplying the ocular (or eyepiece)
value (usually 10X) by the value of the objective lens (a variable
between 0.7 and 3X). The value of the objective lens is selected
using a dial on the body tube of the microscope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">The compound light microscope, shown
in Figure 8, uses two ground glass lenses to form the image. The
lenses in this microscope, however, are aligned with the light source
and specimen so that the light passes through the specimen, rather
than reflects off the surface (as in the dissecting microscope shown
in Figure 7). The compound microscope provides greater magnification
(and resoultion), but only thin specimens (or thin slices of a
specimen) can be viewed with this type of microscope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Electron microscopes, two examples of which are
shown in Fgure 9, are more rarely encountered by beginning biology
students. However, the images gathered from these microscopes reveal
a greater structure of the cell, so some familiarity with the
strengths and weaknesses of each type is useful. Instead of using
light as an imaging source, a high energy beam of electrons (between
five thousand and one billion electron volts) is focused through
electromagnetic lenses (instead of glass lenses used in the light
microscope). The increased resolution results from the shorter
wavelength of the electron beam, increasing resolution in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) to a theoretical limit of 0.2
nm. The magnifications reached by TEMs are commonly over 100,000X,
depending on the nature of the sample and the operating condition of
the TEM. The other type of electron microscope is the scanning
electron microscope (SEM). It uses a different method of electron
capture and displays images on high resolution television monitors.
The resolution and magnification of the SEM are less than that of the
TEM although still orders of magnitude above the LM.</FONT></P>
