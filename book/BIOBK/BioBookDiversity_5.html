are descended from multicellular green algae. Various green algal
groups have been proposed for this ancestral type, with the
Charophytes often being prominently mentioned. Cladistic studies
support the inclusion of the Charophytes (including the taxonomic
order Coleochaetales) as sister taxa to the land plants. Algae
dominated the oceans of the precambrian time over 700 million years
ago. Between 500 and 400 million years ago, some algae made the
transition to land, becoming plants by developing a series of
adaptations to help them survive out of the water.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Organisms in water do not face many of the
challenges that terrestrial creatures do. Water supports the
organism, the moist surface of the creature is a superb surface for
gas exchange, etc. For organisms to exist on land, a variety of
challenges must be met.</FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Drying out. Once removed from water and
   exposed to air, organisms must deal with the need to conserve
   water. A number of approaches have developed, such as the
   development of waterproof skin (in animals), living in very moist
   environments (amphibians, bryophytes), and production of a
   waterproof surface (the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cuticle"><FONT SIZE="+1">cuticle</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   in plants, </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cork"><FONT SIZE="+1">cork</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   layers and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#bark"><FONT SIZE="+1">bark</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   in woody trees). </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Gas exchange. Organisms that live in water are
   often able to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen gases through
   their surfaces. These exchange surfaces are moist, thin layers
   across which </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#diffusion"><FONT SIZE="+1">diffusion</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   can occur. Organismal response to the challenge of drying out
   tends to make these surfaces thicker, waterproof, and to retard
   gas exchange. Consequently, another method of gas exchange must be
   modified or developed. Many fish already had gills and swim
   bladders, so when some of them began moving between ponds, the
   swim bladder (a gas retention structure helping buoyancy in the
   fish) began to act as a gas exchange surface, ultimately evolving
   into the terrestrial lung. Many arthropods had gills or other
   internal respiratory surfaces that were modified to facilitate gas
   exchange on land. Plants are thought to share common ancestry with
   algae. The plant solution to gas exchange is a new structure, the
   </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossG.html#guard cells"><FONT SIZE="+1">guard
   cells</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> that flank openings
   (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#stomata"><FONT SIZE="+1">stomata</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)
   in the above ground parts of the plant. By opening these guard
   cells the plant is able to allow gas exchange by diffusion through
   the open stomata. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Support. Organisms living in water are
   supported by the dense liquid they live in. Once on land, the
   organisms had to deal with the less dense air, which could not
   support their weight. Adaptations to this include animal skeletons
   and specialized plant cells/tissues that support the plant.
   </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Conduction. Single celled organisms only have
   tyo move materials in, out, and within their cells. A
   multicellular creature must do this at each cell in the body, plus
   move material in, out, and within the organism. Adaptations to
   this include the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#circulatory system"><FONT SIZE="+1">circulatory

early vascular plant. It was less than 15 cm tall, with stems that

vascular plants. Some branches terminated in sporangia that produced
a single size of spore. </FONT></P>

some members of the group having the trait, others not. The shapes of
sporangia on various specimens of <I>Cooksonia</I> also vary

include <I>Lycopodium</I> (commonly called the club moss &#91;shown

<I>Selaginella</I> (the so-called resurrection plant).
<I>Lycopodium</I> produces isospores that germinate in the soil and
produce a bisexual gametophyte. These spores are all approximately
the same size. <I>Selaginella</I> and <I>Isoetes </I>are
heterosporous, and thus produce two sizes of spores: small spores
(termed microspores) that germinate to produce the male gametophyte;
and larger spores (megaspores) that germinate to produce the female
gametophyte. The production of two sizes of spores, and also making
separate unisexual gametophytes, is thought an important step toward
the seed. Modern lycophytes are small, herbaceous plants. Many of the
prominent fossil members of this group produced large amounts of wood
and were significant trees in the Carboniferous-aged coal swamps.

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Lepidodendron</I> and

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Lycophytes became significant elements of the
world's flora during the Carboniferous time (the Mississippian and
Pennsylvanian are terms used for this time span in the United
States). These non-seed plants evolved into trees placed in the
fossil genera <I>Lepidodendron</I> and <I>Sigillaria, </I>with
heights reaching up to 40 meters and 20-30 meters respectively.
<I>Lepidodendron</I> stems are composed of less wood (secondary
xylem) that usually is found in gymnosperm and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#angiosperms"><FONT SIZE="+1">angiosperm</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
trees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We know much about the anatomy of these coal-age
lycopods because of an odd type of preservation known as a coal ball.
Coal balls can be peeled and the plants that are anatomically
preserved within them laboriously studied to learn the details of
cell structure of these coal age plants. Additionally, we have some
exceptional petrifactions and compressions that reveal different
layers of the plants' structure. Estimates place the bulk, up to 70%,
of coal material as being derived from lycophytes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Lepidodendron</I>, pictured in Figures 16 and
17, was a heterosporous lycophyte tree common in coal swamps of the
Carboniferous time. As with many large plant fossils, one rarely if
ever finds the entire tree preserved intact. Consequently there are a
number of fossil plant genera that are "organ taxa" and represent
only the leaves (such as <I>Lepidophylloides</I>), reproductive
structures (<I>Lepidostrobus</I>), stem (<I>Lepidodendron</I>),
spores (<I>Lycospora</I>), and roots (<I>Stigmaria</I>).
<I>Lepidodendron</I> had leaves borne spirally on branches that
dichotomously forked, with roots also arising spirally from the
stigmarian axes, and both small (microspores) and large (megaspores)
formed in strobili (a loose type of soft cone). <I>Lepidodendron</I>
may have attained heigths of nearly 40 meters, with trunks nearly 2
meters in diameter. The trees branched extensively and produced a
large number of leaves. When these leaves fell from the branches,
they left behind them the leaf scars characteristic of the genus.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Division Sphenophyta contains once dominant
plants (both arborescent as well as herbaceous) in Paleozoic forests,
equisetophytes are today relegated to minor roles as herbaceous
plants. Today only a single genus, <I>Equisetum</I>, survives. The
group is defined by their jointed stems, with many leaves being
produced at a node, production of isospores in cones borne at the
tips of stems, and spores bearing elaters (devices to aid in spore
dispersal). Sporophyte features are seen in Figure 18. The
gametophyte is small, bisexual, photosynthetic, and free-living.
Silica concentrated in the stems give this group one of their common
names: scouring rushes. These plants were reportedly used by American
pioneers to scour the pots and pans. The fossil members of this group
are often encountered in coal deposits of Carboniferous age in North
America and Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ferns reproduce by spores from which the
free-living bisexual gametophyte generation develops. There are
12,000 species of ferns today, placed in the Division Pteridophyta.
The fossil history of ferns shows them to have been a dominant plant
group during the Paleozoic Era. Most ferns have pinnate leaves,
exhibiting small leaflets on a frond, as shown in Figure 19. Ferns
have megaphyllous leaves, which cause a leaf gap in the vascular
cylinder of the stem/rhizome, as shown in Figure 20. The first ferns
also appear by the end of the Devonian. Some anatomical similarities
suggest that ferns and sphenophytes may have shared a common ancestor
within the trimerophytes.</FONT></P>
