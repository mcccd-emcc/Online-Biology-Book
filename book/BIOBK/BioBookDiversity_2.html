<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Traditional classifications have placed the archea
and bacteria into a single taxonomic kingdom due to theri
morphological similarity. In fact the two groups are extremely
different, as different from each other biochemically as eukaryotes
are from either group. Under the recently devised domain system, the
achaea and bacteria are placed into two separate domains, with the
third one containing all the eukaryotes. This system is shown in
Figure 1. </FONT></P>

nuclear reactors. Possible bacteria-like structures have even been
recovered from 3 billion year old Martian meteorites. If these turn

the bacterial form of life would have existed simultaneously on both
Earth and Mars. However, the cellular nature of the Martian

was proposed by Fancois Jacob and Jacques Monod. Groups of genes
coding for related proteins are arranged in units known as operons,

for a repressor protein that binds to the operator, obstructing the
promoter (thus, transcription) of the structural genes. The regulator
does not have to be adjacent to other genes in the operon. If the
repressor protein is removed, transcription may occur.</FONT></P>

method of reproduction is that all bacterial cells in a colony are
genetically the same. When treating a bacterial disease, a drug that
kills one bacteria of a specific type will normally kill all other
members of that clone (colony) it comes in contact with. Evolution
requires genetic variation on which to operate. How then can bacteria
increase their genetic variation if their typical mode of
reproduction produces clones? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Bacteria can accomplish genetic recombination in
three ways. Conjugation, shown in Figures 11 and 12, is the process
where one bacterium passes DNA to another through a tube (the sex
pilus) that temporarily joins the two conjugating cells. Conjugation
occurs only between bacteria in same or closely related species.
Transformation involves a bacterium taking up free pieces of DNA
secreted by live bacteria or released by dead bacteria. into the
surrounding environment. Recall that Griffith's experiment
demonstrated this process. The third process, transduction, happens
when bacteriophage transfer portions of bacterial DNA from one cell
to another.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Certain types of bacteria can "donate" a piece of

equivalent of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. Note that the entire

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Plasmids sometimes carry genes for resistance to
antibiotics. Since they are also DNA, plasmids can be transferred
between bacteria by any of the three processes mentioned above. Since
genetic recombination does not routinely happen (as it does in
sexually reproducing eukaryotes), mutation is the most important
source of genetic variation for evolutionary change. Normally
bacteria have short generation times, mutations are generated and
distributed throughout bacterial populations more quickly than in
eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have only a single chromosome, which makes
them haploid. Consequently, mutations are not hidden by a dominant
allele, and will be expressed and evaluated by natural selection more
rapidly than in diploid eukaryotes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Endospores are a method of survival, not one of
reproduction. The formation of an endospore is shown in Figure 13.
Certain bacteria will form a spore inside their cell membrane (an
endospore) that allows them to wait out deteriorating environmental
conditions. A small portion of cytoplasm and a chromosome copy are
surrounded by three heavy, protective spore coats. The part of the
bacterial cell outside the endospore deteriorates and the endospore
is released. Endospores allow bacteria that produce them to survive
in the harshest of environments. When conditions once again become
suitable, the endospore absorbs water and grows out of its spore
coat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Certain disease causing bacteria (such as
<I>Bacillus anthracis</I>, the cause of the disease anthrax) can be
virulent (capable of causing an infection) for up to 1300 years after
forming their endospore! Because of this, as well as other factors,
the anthrax bacterium has been considered as a possible biological
weapon. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, several
people died from anthrax exposure, and one postal facility was closed
(as was the U.S. Senate building) for several weeks. As of March
2003, no connection between these events has been definitely
established. </FONT></P>

usually curable with antibiotics, although overuse of antibiotics can

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Treponema pallidum</I> is the bacterial species
that causes syphilis. Syphilis is transmitted from an infected person
to an uninfected one by direct contact with a syphilis sore during
vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Proper use of condoms has been shown to
reduce the incidence of syphilis. Syphilis sores occur mainly on the
genitals, vagina, anus, or in the rectum, as well as on the lips and
inside the mouth. Infected, pregnant women can pass it to their
unborn child. The urban myth about getting this disease from a toilet
seat is untrue. Syphilis cannot be spread by toilet seats, door
knobs, swimming pools, hot tubs, bath tubs, or sharing of clothing or
eating utensils. There are three stages to the disease. The prim,ary
stage is the time between infection and the start of the first
symptom, ranging from 10-90 days. The primary stage normally in
indicated by the appearance of a single sore also known as a chancre.
The chancre is usually round, firm, small and painless, and appears
where syphilis entered the body. If proper treatment is not utilized,
the diease moves into the secondary stage. The second stage occurs
when some area(s) of the skin develop an itchless rash. Rashes can
appear as the chancre is fading or can be delayed for weeks. The rash
often appears as rough, red or reddish brown spots both on the palms
of the hands and on the bottoms of the feet. The rash also may also
appear on other parts of the body.. Even without treatment, rashes
clear up on their own. In addition to rashes, second-stage symptoms
can include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair
loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and tiredness. The
disease can pass to sex partners when primary or secondary stage
symptoms are showing. The latent, or hidden, stage of syphilis
initiates when the symptoms of the second stage disappear. Without
treatment, an infected individual still has syphilis, even though he
or she does not display symptoms. <I>Treponema pallidum</I> remains
in the body, and so may begin to damage internal organs, suc as the
brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints.
This internal damage may not show up until many years later when the
person enters the late or tertiary stage of syphilis. Late stage
symptoms include the inability to coordinate muscle movements,
paralysis, numbness, gradual blindness and dementia. This damage may
be serious enough to cause death. Because of this progress of ther
disease, often resulting in death, the disease was one greatly feared
before the advent of antibiotics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Gonorrhea is another common sexually transmitted
disease caused by <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I>, a bacterium. This
bacterium can grow in the reproductive tract, including the cervix,
uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, as well as in the urethra in
both men and women. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat,
and anus. Gonorrhea is spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sexual
contact. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhea to be
transmitted or acquired. Gonorrhea can also be transmitted during
birth. Symptoms include a burning sensation during urination and a
yellowish white discharge from the penis. Some infected males may
have painful or swollen testicles. Many women often do not show
strong signs of the early symptoms of gonorrhea. The initial symptoms
for women include a painful or burning sensation upon urination, as
well as a yellow or occasionally bloody vaginal discharg. Women with
no or mild gonorrhea symptoms are still at risk of developing serious
complications from the infection. Untreated gonorrhea in women can
develop into pelvic inflammatory disease. Rectal infection has
symptoms such as discharge, anal itching, soreness, bleeding, and
sometimes painful bowel movements. Infections in the throat cause few
symptoms. Penicillin is a common antibiotic no longer used to treat
gonorrhea due to the development of penicillin-resistant strains of
the gonorrhea bacterium. </FONT></P>
