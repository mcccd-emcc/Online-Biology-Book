Development of a cell membrane that could allow somematerials to pass while constraining the movement of other moleculeswas a major step in the evolution of the cell. Cell membranes aredifferentially (or semi-) permeable barriers separating the innercellular environment from the outer cellular (or external)environment. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">Water potential is the tendency of water to movefrom an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.Energy exists in two forms: potential and kinetic. Water moleculesmove according to differences in potential energy between where theyare and where they are going. Gravity and pressure are two enablingforces for this movement. These forces also operate in the hydrologic(water) cycle. Remember in the hydrologic cycle that water runsdownhill (likewise it falls from the sky, to get into the sky it mustbe acted on by the sun and evaporated, thus needing energy input topower the cycle).</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="hydrocyc.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=359 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="+1">The hydrologic cycle. </FONT>Image from Purves etal., <U>Life: The Science of Biology</U>, 4th Edition, by SinauerAssociates (<A HREF="http://www.sinauer.com">www.sinauer.com</A>) andWH Freeman (<A HREF="http://www.whfreeman.com">www.whfreeman.com</A>),used with permission.</P><P><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#diffusion"><FONT SIZE="+1">Diffusion</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">is the net movement of a substance (liquid or gas) from an area ofhigher concentration to one of lower concentration. You are on alarge (10 ft x 10 ft x10 ft) elevator. An obnoxious individual with alit cigar gets on at the third floor with the cigar still burning.You are also unfortunate enough to be in a very tall building and theperson says "Hey we're both going to the 62nd floor!" Disliking smokeyou move to the farthest corner you can. Eventually you are unable toescape the smoke! An example of diffusion in action. Nearer thesource the concentration of a given substance increases. You probablyexperience this in class when someone arrives freshly doused inperfume or cologne, especially the cheap stuff. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">Since the molecules of any substance (solid,liquid, or gas) are in motion when that substance is above absolutezero (0 degrees Kelvin or -273 degrees C), energy is available formovement of the molecules from a higher potential state to a lowerpotential state, just as in the case of the water discussed above.The majority of the molecules move from higher to lowerconcentration, although there will be some that move from low tohigh. The overall (or net) movement is thus from high to lowconcentration. Eventually, if no energy is input into the system themolecules will reach a state of equilibrium where they will bedistributed equally throughout the system.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="6_4.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=145 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="+1">Diffusion of a dye in a beaker of water.</FONT>The above image is from <A HREF="http://www.biosci.uga.edu/almanac/bio_103/notes/may_13.html">http://www.biosci.uga.edu/almanac/bio_103/notes/may_13.html</A>.</P><H2><A NAME="The Cell Membrane"></A>The Cell Membrane | <A HREF="#Table of Contents">Backto Top</A></H2><P><FONT SIZE="+1">The cell membrane functions as a semi-permeablebarrier, allowing a very few molecules across it while fencing themajority of organically produced chemicals inside the cell.

Diffusion is one principle method of movement of substances withincells, as well as the method for essential small molecules to crossthe cell membrane. Gas exchange in gills and lungs operates by thisprocess. Carbon dioxide is produced by all cells as a result ofcellular metabolic processes. Since the source is inside the cell,the concentration gradient is constantly beingreplenished/re-elevated, thus the net flow of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is outof the cell.

Some of these proteins can move materials across the membraneonly when assisted by the concentration gradient, a type ofcarrier-assisted transport known as facilitated diffusion. Bothdiffusion and facilitated diffusion are driven by the potentialenergy differences of a concentration gradient. Glucose enters mostcells by facilitated diffusion. There seem to be a limiting number ofglucose-transporting proteins. The rapid breakdown of glucose in thecell (a process known as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossG.html#glycolysis"><FONT SIZE="+1">glycolysis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)maintains the concentration gradient. When the external concentrationof glucose increases, however, the glucose transport does not exceeda certain rate, suggesting the limitation on transport.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the case of active transport, the proteins arehaving to move against the concentration gradient. For example thesodium-potassium pump in nerve cells. Na<SUP>+</SUP> is maintained atlow concentrations inside the cell and K<SUP>+</SUP> is at higherconcentrations. The reverse is the case on the outside of the cell.When a nerve message is propagated, the ions pass across themembrane, thus sending the message. After the message has passed, theions must be actively transported back to their "starting positions"across the membrane. This is analogous to setting up 100 dominoes andthen tipping over the first one. To reset them you must pick each oneup, again at an energy cost. Up to one-third of the ATP used by aresting animal is used to reset the Na-K pump.</FONT></P><H2><A NAME="Types of transport molecules"></A>Types of transportmolecules | <A HREF="#Table of Contents">Back to Top</A></H2><P><FONT SIZE="+1">Uniport transports one solute at a time.
