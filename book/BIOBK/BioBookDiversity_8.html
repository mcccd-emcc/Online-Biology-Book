<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Gastropoda</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Gastropoda includes snails, terrestrial
slugs, whelks, conchs, periwinkles, sea hares, and sea slugs. Most
gastropods are </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#marine biome"><FONT SIZE="+1">marine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
although some there are freshwater and terrestrial forms. Many
gastropods are </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#herbivores"><FONT SIZE="+1">herbivores</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
that use their radula to scrape food from surfaces. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#carnivores"><FONT SIZE="+1">Carnivorous</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
gastropods use their radula to bore through a surface, such as a
bivalve shell, to obtain food. Most gastropods have a well developed
head with eyes and tentacles projecting from a coiled shell that
protects the visceral mass, as shown in Figure 4. The coiled shells
of gastropods are often quite commonly found as fossils. One genus,
<I>Turetella</I>, occurs in such quantities in a type of rock that
the rock is known as "<I>Turetella</I> agate". However, not all
gastropods have shells, the nudibranchs (sea slugs) and terrestrial
slugs lack shells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In aquatic gastropods, gills are found in the
mantle cavity; in terrestrial gastropods, the mantle is richly
supplied with blood vessels and functions as a lung when air is moved
in and out through respiratory pores. Terrestrial gastropod embryonic
development does not go through a swimming larval stage, as is the
case in aquatic gastropods. For terrestrial snails, their shell not
only offers protection but also prevents desiccation (drying out).
The muscular foot contracts in peristaltic waves from anterior to
posterior causing secretion of a lubricating mucus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Terrestrial gastropods are hermaphroditic. In
premating behavior, they meet and shoot calcareous darts into each
other's body wall. Each inserts a penis into the vagina of the other,
providing sperm for future fertilization of eggs. Eggs are deposited
in the soil and development proceeds without formation of a larval
stage, a common theme in some terrestrial invertebrates.
Hermaphroditism assures that any two animals that meet can mate,
which is especially useful in slow-moving animals. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Bivalvia</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Bivalvia consists of clams, oysters,
mussels, and scallops. Members of this class have two-part shells
that are hinged and closed by powerful muscles. The presence of
shells in this group has yielded an impressive fossil record. The
bivalves have no head, no radula, and little </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cephalization"><FONT SIZE="+1">cephalization</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
as can be seen in Figure 5. Clams use their hatchet-shaped foot for
burrowing; mussels use it to produce threads to attach to objects.
Scallops can both burrow or swim. A rapid closing and opening of
their two valves releases water in spurts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The bivalve shell is secreted by the mantle. The
shell is composed of protein and calcium carbonate with an inner
layer of pearl. Pearls form as layers of shell-forming material
deposited about a foreign particle lodged between the mantle and the
shell. A compressed muscular foot projects down from shell. By
expanding the tip, the foot pulls the body after it. Beating cilia of
the gills cause water to enter the mantle cavity by way of the
incurrent siphon and to exit by way of the excurrent siphon. While
cilia of gills move water through the mantle cavity, gills also
capture particles in water and move them toward the mouth. From the
mouth food goes to the stomach, then to the intestine, which passes
through the heart and ends at the anus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Bivalves, like other mollusks, have an open
circulatory system. Their nervous system consists of three pairs of
ganglia. Two excretory kidneys below the heart remove ammonia waste
from the pericardial cavity into the mantle cavity, from which it
will leave the body.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Sexes in class Bivalvia are separate. The gonad is
located around the coils of the intestine. Certain clams and annelids
have the same type of larva, hinting at a possible evolutionary
relationship between the two groups. </FONT></P>

 Fossil Record of Bivalves</FONT></H5>

this class is remarkably good. Hard shells (or hard parts) are one of
the features that make an organism a better candidate to become a

 During the Mesozoic era, bivalves became more abundant and important
parts of reefs. They would would remain important parts of the marine
fauna throughout the Mesozoic. These bivalves, specifically the
rudistids (Figure 7), began to play a larger role in reef formation.
Rudistid reefs are so named because the rudistid bivalves were the
dominant reef-forming organisms. Biodiversity was reduced by mass
extinctions at the end of the Triassic and Jurassic periods of the
mesozoic era.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Cephalopoda (literally "head-footed")
includes squids, cuttlefish, octopuses, and nautiluses (and extinct
relatives, the goniatites, ammonoids, and ammonites). The presence of
a shell in many representatives of this class has yielded an
impressive fossil record. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Squids and octopuses can squeeze water from their
mantle cavity out through a funnel (shown in Figure 9), thus
propelling them with a form of jet propulsion. Surrounding their head
are tentacles with suckers that can grasp prey and deliver it to a
powerful beak/mouth. Cephalopods in general have well-developed sense
organs, including focusing camera-type eyes. Most cephalopods,
especially octopuses, have well-developed brains and show a capacity
for learning. Nautiluses are enclosed in shells, squids have a shell
that is reduced and internal, while octopuses lack a
shell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Squids and octopuses possess ink sacs from which
they squirt a cloud of ink, as a means of escaping predators. Squids
possess a vestigial skeleton under the mantle, called the pen, which
surrounds the visceral mass. A squid has three hearts, one pumps
blood to internal organs; two pump blood to the gills in the mantle
cavity. Gonads make up a large portion of the visceral mass.
Cephalopds have separate sexes. Spermatophores contain sperm, which
the male passes to the female mantle cavity by way of one of his
tentacles. After fertilization, eggs are attached to the substratum
in strings containing up to 100 eggs.</FONT></P>

 The ammonoids underwent three separate diversifications from a
nautiloid-like stock. In each case the fold pattern of sutures became
more complex. These sutire patterns are fantastic characters for
identifying species, making ammonoids excellent index fossils. The
first of these occurrences was the goniatites, a group that ranged
from the Devonian to the Permian. The ceratites are a Triassic group,
while the last group, the ammonites ranged from the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#Triassic Period"><FONT SIZE="+1">Triassic</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
to the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#Cretaceous Period"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cretaceous</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Ammonoids finally went extinct in the great end-of-the-Cretaceous
extinction. Nautiloids are represented today by the <I>Nautilus</I>.
Differences between the groups are shown in Figure 12. </FONT></P>

 The cephalopods recovered from the extinction of the goniatites at
the close of the Paleozoic era and developed a remarkably similar
group, the ceratites. These coiled, chambered animals, such as the
one shown in Figure 12, had slightly more complex sutures than did
the goniatites. However, the Ceratites also went extinct during the
middle Mesozoic era.</FONT></P>

 During the Jurassic, the cephalopods once again produced a new
coiled, chambered form, the ammonites, shown in Figure 13 and 14.
Suture patterns of these forms were even more elaborate than those
found in the Triassic ceratites. The belemnites were straight-shelled
cephalopods with elaborate suture patterns. Both ammonites and
belemnites survived the Jurassic extinctions and flourished during
the Cretaceous period.</FONT></P>

Ammonites continued their dominance, as did their relatives the
straight-shelled belemnites. Modern teleost fish appeared during the
Cretaceous and may have competed for the same prey as the ammonites.
The teleost fish were apparently stronger and swifter swimmers than
the fish of the Jurassic. Some paleontologists speculate that the
extinction of ichthyosaurs during the Cretaceous may have been
hastened by the rise of these new faster fish that would have been
difficult for the ichthyosaurs to catch and eat. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Classification of the Annelida</FONT></H3>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Polychaeta</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most annelids belonging to the taxonomic class
Polychaeta are marine and possess parapodia and setae. Parapodia are
paddlelike appendages used in swimming that also serve as respiratory
organs. Setae are bristles, attached to parapodia, that help anchor
polychaetes to their substratum and also help them move. Clam worms,
such as <I>Nereis,</I> are active </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#predation"><FONT SIZE="+1">predators</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Many have well-developed cephalization, with a head having
well-developed jaws, eyes, and other sense organs. Sedentary filter
feeders possess tentacles with cilia to create water currents and to
select food particles. Only during breeding do polychaetes have
reproductive organs. Polychaet zygotes develop into a type of larva
similar to that produced by marine clams.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Oligochaeta</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Oligochaeta includes earthworms, that
tend to have their few setae protruding in clusters directly from
their body. Earthworms have poorly developed heads or parapodia.
Locomotion is by coordinated movement of the body muscles and
assistance of their setae. When longitudinal muscles contract,
segments bulge and setae protrude and anchor into the soil. Circular
muscles contract, causing the worm to lengthen, setae are withdrawn
and the segment moves forward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Earthworms reside in moist soil where a moist body
wall facilitates gas exchange. Earthworms are scavengers that extract
organic remains from the soil they eat. A muscular </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pharynx"><FONT SIZE="+1">pharynx</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
draws food into the mouth. Ingested food is stored in a crop and
ground up in a muscular gizzard. The dorsal surface of the intestine
is expanded into a typhlosole that allows more surface area for
digestion. External segments correspond to internal septa (walls)
separating each body segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The earthworm excretory system has coiled
nephridia tubules in each segment with two openings: one is a
ciliated funnel that collects coelomic fluid, and the other is an
exit in the body wall. Between the two openings, the coiled nephridia
tubule allows removal of waste materials from blood
vessels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Red blood is moved anteriorly by a dorsal blood
vessel and pumped by five pairs of hearts (sometimes referred to as
aortic arches) to a ventral vessel. Earthworms are hermaphroditic,
having both testes with seminal vesicles, and ovaries with seminal
receptacles. Mating involves the worms lying parallel to each other
facing opposite directions and exchanging sperm. Each worm possesses
a clitellum that then secretes a mucus, protecting sperm and eggs
from drying out. Embryonic development lacks a larval
stage.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Hirudinea</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Hirudinea includes leeches. Most are
freshwater, but a few are marine or terrestrial. Each body ring has
several transverse grooves. Leeches possess a small anterior sucker
around the mouth and a larger posterior sucker. Although some are
free-living predators, most are fluid feeders. Bloodsuckers keep
blood from coagulating by hirudin, an anticoagulant in their saliva.
Leeches were commonly used in early medicine to "bleed" the patient.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Due to their great diversity of appendages,
lifestyles, and other features, arthropods are usually separated into
several subphylums. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Subphylum Chelicerata</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The subphylum Chelicerata includes spiders,
scorpions, ticks, mites, horseshoe crabs, etc. The first pair of
appendages are chelicerae, second pair are pedipalps, and the next
four pairs are walking legs. Chelicerae are appendages that function
as feeding organs. Pedipalps are feeding or sensory in function;
although in scorpions, they are large pincers. All appendages attach
to a cephalothorax, a fusion of the head and thoracic regions. The
head lacks antennae, mandibles, or maxillae appendages.</FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Merostomata</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Merostomata contains the extinct "sea
scorpions" (or eurypterids) and the extant (living) horseshoe crabs.
Eurypterids are extinct, but were important elements of faunas
200-500 million years ago during the Paleozoic Era. Some were huge,
reaching a length of over 10 feet. Some eurypterids may have been
amphibious, emerging onto land for at least part of their life.
Horseshoe crabs are an ancient group consisting today of only 5
species. Members of this class have a large shield that covers the
cephalothorax. The compound eyes are reduced. The second pair of
appendages, the pedipalps, resemble walking legs. They have a long,
spike-like appendage called a telson that projects from the rear of
their bodies. Respiration is via book gills (precursors to book
lungs?). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The horseshoe crab genus <I>Limulus</I> is a
familiar sight along the east coast of North America. The anterior
shield is a horseshoe-shaped carapace with two compound eyes. The
long, unsegmented telson projects to the rear. They possess book
gills that resemble the pages in a book. <I>Limulus</I> is considered
a living fossil due to its great similarity to fossil forms from the
Paleozoic Era. </FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Arachnida</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Arachnida includes over 60,000 described
species (and most likely a very large number of as yet undescribed
ones) of spiders (around 35,000 species), mites and ticks (25,000
species), scorpions (1200 species), and other forms. Nearly all
arachnids are terrestrial. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Arachnids have a cephalothorax covered with a
carapace-like shield. The abdomen may be segmented or unsegmented.
Appendages on the abdomen are absent or modified, for example forming
the spinnerets of spiders. Respiration is via tracheae or book lungs.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scorpions are arachnids. They are the oldest
terrestrial arthropods known from fossils. All scorpions are
nocturnal and spend most of the day hidden under a log or rock. Their
pedipalps are large pincerlike appendages, and their abdomen ends in
a stinger containing venom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ticks, shown in Figure 17, are parasites that suck
blood and sometimes transmit diseases. Chiggers are larvae of certain
mites and feed on the skin of vertebrates.</FONT></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">Malacostraca is the largest taxonomic class of
Crustaceans, having over 20,000 primarily marine species. Some
malacostracans are freshwater, while others occupy diverse
terrestrial habitats. Typical malacostracans include sowbugs, krill,
and a very large order, the Decapoda, that contains many kinds of
shrimp, crabs, and crayfish. Malacostracans typically possess a body
with eight thoracic and six abdominal body segments, each bearing a
pair of appendages. Class Malacostraca contains a number of
economically significant species, such as edible lobsters, shrimp,
crayfish and crabs. Many malacostracans contribute to

chain. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Subphylum Uniramia</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">This subphylum contains arthropods that have
unbranched appendages. The uniramian body has two or three tagmata,
and an abdomen that has many segments. Appendages in the head region
include paired antennae and mandibles, and also two pairs of
maxillae. Gas exchange is by means of tracheae and spiracles. This
subphylum include millipedes, centipedes, and insects.

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Chilopoda</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">This taxonomic class includes 20 families and more
than 2500 species of centipedes, all terrestrial. Most centipedes are
small, but a few can attain a length of up to 10 inches (25 cm).
Centipedes have bodies are made up of a chain of many (up to 177)
flattened segments. With the exception of the segment behind the head
and the last body segment, each segment has a single pair of
appendages (legs). The appendages of the first body segment have been
modified to form large, poisonous fangs that are used to capture
prey. The bite of a large centipede, however, can be painful to an
adult and dangerous to a small child.</FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Diplopoda</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Millipedes, Figure 20, comprise this class
containing some 8000 species. Bodies of members of this class are
made up of numerous segments. Millipedes lack poisonous fangs and do
not bite. Prerdators are discoraged by the millipede's rolling into a
defensive ball. Production of poisonous or foul-smelling substances
also serve to disuade any would be predators. Most millipedes are apt
burrowing herbivores or scavengers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Insects have a complete, complex digestive system.
They exchange gases through a tracheal system, with external openings
called spiracles dividing into finely branched tubules that carry
gases directly to metabolizing tissues. Aquatic forms may exchange
gases through the body wall or may have various kinds of gills.
Excretion of nitrogenous waste takes place via Malpighian tubules.
The nervous system of insects is complex, including a number of
ganglia and a ventral, double nerve cord. Sense organs are complex
and acute. In addition to ocelli and compound eyes, some insects are
quite sensitive to sounds, and their chemoreceptive abilities are
excellent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Growth patterns are quite variable. Some insects
hatch from eggs as miniature adults, which in turn shed their
exoskeleton. Most insect species have newly hatched young that are
completely different in appearance from adults. These larval forms
usually live in different habitats, eat different foods, and look
completely different from their adult stages. When larval growth is
completed, the larva stops feeding and builds a case or cocoon around
itself. In this nonfeeding condition (pupa or chrysalis) the larva
undergoes a complete transformation or "metamorphosis" of its body
form, eventually emerging as a fully-formed adult. </FONT></P>

organ level of organization, the tube-within-a-tube body plan, and a
true coelom. The coelom, a body cavity between the digestive tract
and body wall completely lined by mesoderm allows the digestive
system and body wall to move independently. Because of this, internal
organs can be more complex. Coelomic fluid assists respiration and
circulation by diffusing nutrients, and excretion by accumulating
wastes. This fluid functions in place of several organ systems in
higher animals such as mammals. The coelom may serve as a storage
area for eggs and sperm, facilitating development of these gametes
within the animal body. Coelomic fluid protects internal organs and
also serves as a hydrostatic skeleton. Protostomes develop their
embryo by spiral cleavage, as shown by Figure 23. </FONT></P>
