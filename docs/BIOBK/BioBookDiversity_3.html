<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The transition to eukaryotic cells appears to have
occurred during the Proterozoic Era, about 1.2 to 1.5 billion years
ago. However, recent genetic studies suggest eukaryotes diverged from
prokaryotes closer to 2 billion years ago. Fossils do not yet agree
with this date. The old Kingdom Protista, as I learned it long ago,
thus contains some living groups that might serve as possible models
for the early eukaryotes. This taxonomic kingdom has been broken into
many new kingdoms, reflecting new studies and techniques that help
elucidate the true phylogenetic sequence of life on Earth.

alternation between diploid and haploid phases that is similar to the

from diploid dominant, to haploid dominant. A generalized eukaryote
life cycle is shown in Figure 1. </FONT></P>

evolved several times from various groups of prokaryotes. This makes
the Protista a polyphyletic group. Eukaryotes are generally larger,
have a variety of membrane-bound organelles, greater internal
complexity than prokaryotic cells, and has a secialized method of
cell division (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#meiosis"><FONT SIZE="+1">meiosis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)

survive without their mitochondria (likewise photosynthetic
eukaryotes cannot survive without their chloroplasts), and the
endosymbionts cannot survive outside their hosts. Nearly all (but not

and some organisms that can vary their nutritional mode depending on
environmental conditions. Protists occur in freshwater, saltwater,
soil, and as symbionts within other organisms. Due to this tremendous
diversity, classification of the Protista is difficult. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Historically the group has been subdivied based on
the mode of nutrition, photosynthestic pigments, and the type of
organelles used for locomotion. For example, the organisms using
cilia to propel themselves were all placed in the Phylum Ciliata;
those using pseudopodia were all in the Phylum Sarcodina. This is an
example of form classification, and worked well enough until
scientists began to examine the protists both biochemically and
ultratsructurally (with electron microscopes). They discovered the
form classification mentioned above did not support the existence of
monophyletic groups, and thus should be abandoned. Several new
kingdoms have been proposed for the old protista, although consensus
amongst systematists working with these groups has yet to fully
emerge. Several organisms once placed in the protists have been moved
to other Kingdoms, while others have moved from the Kingdom Fungi to
the protists.</FONT></P>

mitochondria. Scientists interpret this as an indication of the
divergence of this group from other "protists" prior to the
endosymbiosis event that led to the development of the mitochondrion.
However, some recent studies seem to indicate that some of the
organisms placed in this group are secondarily mitochondrialess:
their ancestors had mitochondria but lost them over time. This casts
doubt on the monophyletic nature of this proposed kingdom.

cell wall comnprised of two halves technically referred to as valves.
These valves are mostly made of silica (SiO<SUB>2</SUB>). The diatom
cell wall is perforated by numerous small openings. When diatoms
reproduce asexually, each received one old valve. The new valve fits
inside the old one; therefore, the new diatom is smaller than the
original one. Once the shells reach a certain size the diatom
reproduces sexually and restores its size, allowing the asexual
reproduction cycle to begin anew. </FONT></P>

about 580 species. As indicated by the name, once this group was
considered to belong to the fungi. Aquatic water molds parasitize
fishes, forming furry growths on their gills. Some terrestrial water
molds parasitize insects and plants; water mold was responsible for
Irish potato famine. The body of water molds is filamentous, although
cell walls are largely composed of cellulose (fungi have chitin in
their cell walls). During asexual reproduction, they produce diploid
motile spores (2n zoospores; most fungi lack motile spores). Unlike
fungi, the adult phase of the life cycle is diploid, producing
gametes by meiosis. Eggs are produced in enlarged structures known as
oogonia.</FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">The Irish Problem</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Irish potato famine was a terrible disaster
caused by a water mold, <I>Phytophthora infestans</I>. This scourge
is an example of the impact that a disease can have on the political,
economic and social structure of several countries. The potato is a
crop imported from South America. The potato was planted in Ireland,
and the population of Ireland exploded from 4.5 million in 1800 to
about 8 million in 1845. Most of the Irish were dependent on the
potato for their food for ten months of the year. The late blight of
potato thus had a very serious consequence to the Irish: famine and
starvation. Between 1845 and 1860 over one million Irish died as a
result of the famine brought about by the blight. During the same
timespan, another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the east coast of
the United States. Among immigrants during this time were ancestors
of Presidents Kennedy and Reagan, among many others.</FONT></P>
