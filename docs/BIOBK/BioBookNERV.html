<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The plasma membrane of neurons, like all other
cells, has an unequal distribution of ions and electrical charges
between the two sides of the membrane. The outside of the membrane
has a positive charge, inside has a negative charge. This charge
difference is a resting potential and is measured in millivolts.
Passage of ions across the cell membrane passes the electrical charge
along the cell. The voltage potential is -65mV (millivolts) of a cell
at rest (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#resting potential"><FONT SIZE="+1">resting
potential</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">). Resting potential results from
differences between sodium and potassium positively charged ions and
negatively charged ions in the cytoplasm. Sodium ions are more
concentrated outside the membrane, while potassium ions are more
concentrated inside the membrane. This imbalance is maintained by the
active transport of ions to reset the membrane known as the sodium
potassium pump. The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sodium-potassium pump"><FONT SIZE="+1">sodium-potassium
pump</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> maintains this unequal concentration
by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#active transport"><FONT SIZE="+1">actively

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Changed polarity of the membrane, the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#action potential"><FONT SIZE="+1">action
potential</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, results in propagation of the
nerve impulse along the membrane. An action potential is a temporary
reversal of the electrical potential along the membrane for a few
milliseconds. Sodium gates and potassium gates open in the membrane
to allow their respective ions to cross. Sodium and potassium ions
reverse positions by passing through membrane protein channel gates
that can be opened or closed to control ion passage. Sodium crosses
first. At the height of the membrane potential reversal, potassium
channels open to allow potassium ions to pass to the outside of the
membrane. Potassium crosses second, resulting in changed ionic
distributions, which must be reset by the continuously running
sodium-potassium pump. Eventually enough potassium ions pass to the
outside to restore the membrane charges to those of the original
resting potential.The cell begins then to pump the ions back to their
original sides of the membrane. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The action potential begins at one spot on the
membrane, but spreads to adjacent areas of the membrane, propagating
the message along the length of the cell membrane. After passage of
the action potential, there is a brief period, the refractory period,
during which the membrane cannot be stimulated. This prevents the
message from being transmitted backward along the
membrane.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Arrival of the action potential causes some of the
vesicles to move to the end of the axon and discharge their contents
into the synaptic cleft. Released neurotransmitters diffuse across
the cleft, and bind to receptors on the other cell's membrane,
causing ion channels on that cell to open. Some neurotransmitters
cause an action potential, others are inhibitory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Neurotransmitters tend to be small molecules, some
are even hormones. The time for neurotransmitter action is between
0,5 and 1 millisecond. Neurotransmitters are either destroyed by
specific enzymes in the synaptic cleft, diffuse out of the cleft, or
are reabsorbed by the cell. More than 30 organic molecules are
thought to act as neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters cross the
cleft, binding to receptor molecules on the next cell, prompting
transmission of the message along that cell's membrane.
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#acetylcholine"><FONT SIZE="+1">Acetylcholine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is an example of a neurotransmitter, as is </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#norepinephrine"><FONT SIZE="+1">norepinephrine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
although each acts in different responses. Once in the cleft,
neurotransmitters are active for only a short time. Enzymes in the
cleft inactivate the neurotransmitters. Inactivated neurotransmitters
are taken back into the axon and recycled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Diseases that affect the function of signal
transmission can have serious consequences. Parkinson's disease has a
deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Progressive death of
brain cells increases this deficit, causing tremors, rigidity and
unstable posture. L-dopa is a chemical related to dopamine that eases
some of the symptoms (by acting as a substitute neurotransmitter) but
cannot reverse the progression of the disease.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The bacterium <I>Clostridium tetani</I> produces a
toxin that prevents the release of GABA. GABA is important in control
of skeletal muscles. Without this control chemical, regulation of
muscle contraction is lost; it can be fatal when it effects the
muscles used in breathing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Clostridium botulinum</I> produces a toxin
found in improperly canned foods. This toxin causes the progressive
relaxation of muscles, and can be fatal. A wide range of drugs also
operate in the synapses: cocaine, LSD, caffeine, and
insecticides.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Multicellular animals must monitor and maintain a

external environment. In many animals, these two functions are

nervous system and the endocrine system. Click </FONT><A HREF="http://www.anatomical.com/chartsfullsize/nervous.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Sensory Input</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Receptors are parts of the nervous system that
sense changes in the internal or external environments. Sensory input
can be in many forms, including pressure, taste, sound, light, blood
pH, or hormone levels, that are converted to a signal and sent to the
brain or spinal cord.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Integration and Output</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the sensory centers of the brain or in the
spinal cord, the barrage of input is integrated and a response is
generated. The response, a motor output, is a signal transmitted to
organs than can convert the signal into some form of action, such as
movement, changes in heart rate, release of hormones, etc.
</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Endocrine Systems</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Some animals have a second control system, the
endocrine system. The nervous system coordinates rapid responses to
external stimuli. The endocrine system controls slower, longer
lasting responses to internal stimuli. Activity of both systems is
integrated.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Divisions of the Nervous System</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The nervous system monitors and controls almost
every organ system through a series of positive and negative feedback
loops.The Central Nervous System (CNS) includes the brain and spinal
cord. The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) connects the CNS to other
parts of the body, and is composed of nerves (bundles of
neurons).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Not all animals have highly specialized nervous
systems. Those with simple systems tend to be either small and very
mobile or large and immobile. Large, mobile animals have highly
developed nervous systems: the evolution of nervous systems must have

mobility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Chordates have a dorsal rather than ventral
nervous system. Several evolutionary trends occur in chordates:
spinal cord, continuation of cephalization in the form of larger and
more complex brains, and development of a more elaborate nervous
system. The vertebrate nervous system is divided into a number of
parts. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord.
The peripheral nervous system consists of all body nerves. Motor
neuron pathways are of two types: somatic (skeletal) and autonomic
(smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands). The autonomic system is
subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The spinal cord runs along the dorsal side of the
body and links the brain to the rest of the body. Vertebrates have
their spinal cords encased in a series of (usually) bony vertebrae
that comprise the vertebral column.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The gray matter of the spinal cord consists mostly
of cell bodies and dendrites. The surrounding white matter is made up
of bundles of interneuronal axons (tracts). Some tracts are ascending
(carrying messages to the brain), others are descending (carrying
messages from the brain). The spinal cord is also involved in
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#reflex"><FONT SIZE="+1">reflexes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
that do not immediately involve the brain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Some neurotransmitters are excitory, such as
acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Some are
associated with relaxation, such as dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine
release seems related to sensations of pleasure. Endorphins are
natural opioids that produce elation and reduction of pain, as do
artificial chemicals such as opium and heroin. Neurological diseases,
for example </FONT><A HREF="http://www.aan.com:80/public/park.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Parkinson's
disease</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> and Huntington's disease, are
due to imbalances of neurotransmitters. Parkinson's is due to a
dopamine deficiency. Huntington's disease is thought to be cause by
malfunctioning of an inhibitory neurotransmitter. </FONT><A HREF="http://www.aan.com:80/public/alzh.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Alzheimer's
disease</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is associated with protein
plaques in the brain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Drugs are stimulants or depressants that block or
enhance certain neurotransmitters. Dopamine is thought involved with
all forms of pleasure. Cocaine interferes with uptake of dopamine
from the synaptic cleft. Alcohol causes a euphoric "high" followed by
a depression. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Marijuana, material from the Indian hemp plant
(<I>Cannabis sativa</I>), has a potent chemical THC
(tetrahydracannibinol) that in low, concentrations causes a euphoric
high (if inhaled, the most common form of action is smoke
inhalation). High dosages may cause severe effects such as
hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and psychotic
symptoms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Cocaine is derives from the plant <I>Erthoxylon
coca.</I> Inhaled, smoked or injected. Cocaine users report a "rush"
of euphoria following use. Following the rush is a short (5-30
minute) period of arousal followed by a depression. Repeated cycle of
use terminate in a "crash" when the cocaine is gone. Prolonged used
causes production of less dopamine, causing the user to need more of
the drug.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Heroin is a derivative of morphine, which in turn
is obtained from opium, the milky secretions obtained from the opium
poppy, <I>Papaver somniferum</I>. Heroin is usually injected
intravenously, although snorting and smoking serve as alternative
delivery methods. Heroin binds to ophioid receptors in the brain,
where the natural chemical endorphins are involved in the cessation
pain. Heroin is physically addictive, and prolonged use causes less
endorphin production. Once this happens, the euphoria is no longer
felt, only dependence and delay of withdrawal symptoms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Input to the nervous system is in the form of our
five senses: pain, vision, taste, smell, and hearing. Vision, taste,
smell, and hearing input are the special senses. Pain, temperature,
and pressure are known as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#somatic senses"><FONT SIZE="+1">somatic
senses</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. Sensory input begins with sensors
that react to stimuli in the form of energy that is transmitted into
an action potential and sent to the CNS.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Sensory Receptors</FONT></H4>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Sensory receptors are classified according to
   the type of energy they can detect and respond to. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Mechanoreceptors: hearing and balance,
   stretching. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Photoreceptors: light. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Chemoreceptors: smell and taste mainly, as

   systems.</FONT></LI>

   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Electroreceptors: detect electrical currents
   in the surrounding environment. </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mechanoreceptors vary greatly in the specific type
of stimulus and duration of stimulus/action potentials. The most
adaptable vertebrate mechanoreceptor is the hair cell. Hair cells are
present in the lateral line of fish. In humans and mammals hair cells
are involved with detection of sound and gravity and providing
balance. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Hearing</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hearing involves the actions of the external ear,
eardrum, ossicles, and cochlea. In hearing, sound waves in air are
converted into vibrations of a liquid then into movement of hair
cells in the cochlea. Finally they are converted into action
potentials in a sensory dendrite connected to the auditory nerve.
Very loud sounds can cause violent vibrations in the membrane under
hair cells, causing a shearing or permanent distortion to the cells,
resulting in permanent hearing loss.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Orientation and Gravity</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Orientation and gravity are detected at the
semicircular canals. Hair cells along three planes respond to shifts
of liquid within the cochlea, providing a three-dimensional sense of
equilibrium. Calcium carbonate crystals can shift in response to
gravity, providing sensory information about gravity and
acceleration. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Photoreceptors Detect Vision and Light
Sensitivity</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The human eye can detect light in the 400-700
nanometer (nm) range, a small portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum, the visible light spectrum. Light with wavelengths shorter
than 400 nm is termed ultraviolet (UV) light. Light with wavelengths
longer than 700 nm is termed infrared (IR) light. </FONT></P>
