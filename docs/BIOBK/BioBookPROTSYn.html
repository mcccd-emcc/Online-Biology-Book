<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the 1930s, despite great advances,
geneticists had several frustrating questions yet to answer:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">What exactly are genes? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">How do they work? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">What produces the unique phenotype associated with
a specific allele?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Answers from physics, chemistry, and the study of
infectious disease gave rise to the field of molecular biology.
Biochemical reactions are controlled by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#enzymes"><FONT SIZE="+1">enzymes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
and often are organized into chains of reactions known as
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#metabolic pathway"><FONT SIZE="+1">metabolic
pathways</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. Loss of activity in a single
enzyme can inactivate an entire pathway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Archibald Garrod, in 1902, first proposed the
relationship through his study of alkaptonuria and its association
with large quantities "alkapton". He reasoned unaffected individuals
metabolized "alkapton" (now called homogentistic acid) to other
products so it would not buildup in the urine. Garrod suspected a
blockage of the pathway to break this chemical down, and proposed
that condition as "an inborn error of metabolism". He also discovered
alkaptonuria was inherited as a recessive Mendelian trait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">George Beadle and Edward Tatum during the late
1930s and early 1940s established the connection Garrod suspected
between genes and metabolism. They used X rays to cause mutations in
strains of the mold <I>Neurospora</I>. These mutations affected a
single genes and single enzymes in specific metabolic pathways.
Beadle and Tatum proposed the "one gene one enzyme hypothesis" for
which they won the Nobel Prize in 1958.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Since the chemical reactions occurring in the body
are mediated by enzymes, and since enzymes are proteins and thus
heritable traits, there must be a relationship between the gene and
proteins. George Beadle, during the 1940s, proposed that mutant eye
colors in <I>Drosophila</I> was caused by a change in one protein in
a biosynthetic pathway. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1941 Beadle and coworker Edward L. Tatum
decided to examine step by step the chemical reactions in a pathway.
They used <I>Neurospora crassa</I> as an experimental organism. It
had a short life-cycle and was easily grown. Since it is
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#haploid"><FONT SIZE="+1">haploid</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
for much of its life cycle, mutations would be immediately expressed.
The meiotic products could be easily inspected. Chromosome mapping
studies on the organism facilitated their work. <I>Neurospora</I> can
be grown on a minimal medium, and it's nutrition could be studied by
its ability to metabolize sugars and other chemicals the scientist
could add or delete from the mixture of the medium. It was able to
synthesize all of the amino acids and other chemicals needed for it
to grow, thus mutants in synthetic pathways would easily show up.
X-rays induced mutations in <I>Neurospora</I>, and the mutated spores
were placed on growth media enriched with all essential amino acids.
Crossing the mutated fungi with non-mutated forms produced spores
which were then grown on media supplying only one of the 20 essential
amino acids. If a spore lacked the ability to synthesize a particular
amino acid, such as Pro (proline), it would only grow if the Proline
was in the growth medium. Biosynthesis of amino acids (the building
blocks of proteins) is a complex process with many chemical reactions
mediated by enzymes, which if mutated would shut down the pathway,
resulting in no-growth. Beadle and Tatum proposed the
"</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#&quot;one gene, one enzyme hypothesi"><FONT SIZE="+1">one
gene one enzyme</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">" theory. One gene codes
for the production of one protein. "One gene one enzyme" has since
been modified to "</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#&quot;one gene, one polypeptide hypo"><FONT SIZE="+1">one
gene one polypeptide</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">" since many proteins
(such as hemoglobin) are made of more than one
polypeptide.</FONT></P>

defective hemoglobin is made, ultimately causing pain and death to
those individuals homozygous recessive for the trait. Pauling
reasoned that if Beadle and Tatum were correct, there should be a
slight (but detectable) difference between the structure of a normal
(HH) and sickle cell (hh) hemoglobin due to genetic differences.
Heterozygotes (Hh, also sampled by Pauling) make both normal and
"sickle cell" hemoglobins. Later, Vernon Ingram discovered that the
normal and sickle-cell hemoglobins differ by only 1 (out of a total

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists for some time had suspected such a link
between DNA and proteins. Cells of developing embryos contain high
levels of RNA. Rapidly growing <I>E. coli</I> has half its mass as

</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#ribosomal RNA"><FONT SIZE="+1">ribosomal
RNA</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> or rRNA) and 1/3 protein. RNA is
synthesized from viral DNA in an infected cell before protein
synthesis begins. Some viruses, for example Tobacco Mosaic Virus
(TMV) have RNA in place of DNA. If RNA extracted from a virus was
injected into a host cell the cell began to make new viruses. Clearly
RNA was involved in protein synthesis.</FONT></P>

a specific amino acid or a control word). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The genetic code was broken by Marshall Nirenberg
and Heinrich Matthaei, a decade after Watson and Crick's work.
Nirenberg discovered that RNA, regardless of its source organism,
could initiate protein synthesis when combined with contents of
broken E. coli cells. By adding poly-U to each of 20 test-tubes (each
tube having a different "tagged" amino acid) Nirenberg and Matthaei
were able to determine that the codon UUU (the only one in poly-U)
coded for the amino acid phenylalanine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We earlier defined mutations as any change in the
DNA. We now can refine that definition: a mutation is a change in the
DNA base sequence that results in a change of amino acid(s) in the
polypeptide coded for by that gene. Alleles are alternate sequences
of DNA bases (genes), and thus at the molecular level the products of
alleles differ (often by only a single amino acid, which can have a
ripple effect on an organism by changing ). Addition, deletion, or
addition of nucleotides can alter the polypeptide. Point mutations
are the result of the substitution of a single base. Frame-shift
mutations occur when the reading frame of the gene is shifted by
addition or deletion of one or more bases. With the exception of
mitochondria, all organisms use the same genetic code. Powerful
evidence for the common ancestry of all living things. </FONT></P>
