gibbons, monkeys, and apes. Although we have significant differences
from other primates, we share an evolutionary history that includes
traits such as opposable thumbs, stereoscopic vision, larger brains,
and nails replacing claws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Primates are relatively unspecialized mammals:
they have no wings, still have all four limbs, cannot run very fast,
have generally weak teeth, and lack armor or thick protective
hides.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">However, the combination of primate
adaptations that include larger brains, tool use, social structure,
stereoscopic color vision, highly developed forelimbs and hands,
versatile teeth, and upright posture, place them among the most
advanced mammals (at least as judged from an anthrocentric
perspective!). </FONT></P>

primates can also swivel or turn their arms at the shoulder.</FONT>

trees.</FONT></P>

forelimbs.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">They are able to grasp objects with
their forelimbs in what is known as a prehensile movement.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Upright posture allows a primate to view its
surroundings as well as to use its hands for some other task.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Hominids, the lineage leading to humans, had changes
in the shape and size of their pelvis, femur, and knees that allowed
bipedalism (walking on two legs). The change from quadruped to biped
happened in stages, culminating in humans, who can walk or run on two
legs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Several trends of primate evolution are evident in
the teeth and jaw.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">First, change in the
geometry of the jaw reduced the snout into a flat face.</FONT>

increased the efficiency of those teeth for grinding food. Third,
about 1.5 million years ago our diet changed from fruits and
vegetables to include meat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Australopithecus afarensis</I>, the first of
the human-like hominids we know of, first appeared about 3.6-4
million years ago. This species had a combination of human
(bipedalism) and apelike features (short legs and relatively long
arms).</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The arm bones were curved like chimps,
but the elbows were more human-like.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists speculate that <I>A. afarensis</I> spent
some time climbing trees, as well as on the ground.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Australopithecus ramidus</I> is an older
species, about 4.4 million years, and is generally considered more
anatomically primitive than <I>A. afarensis</I>. The relationship
between the two species remains to be solved. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The role of <I>A. afarensis</I> as the stem from
which the other hominids arose is in some dispute. About 2 million
years ago, after a long million year period of little change, as many
as six hominid species evolved in response to climate changes
associated with the beginning of the Ice Age. Two groups developed:
the australopithecines, generally smaller brained and not users of
tools; and the line that led to genus <I>Homo</I>, larger brained and
makers and users of tools. The australopithecines died out 1 million
years ago; <I>Homo</I>, despite their best efforts (atomic weapons,
pollution) are still here! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">With an incomplete fossil record,
australopithecines, at least the smaller form, <I>A. africanus</I>,
was thought ancestral to <I>Homo</I>. Recent discoveries, however
have caused a reevaluation of that hypothesis.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">One pattern is sure, human traits evolved at
different rates and at different times, in a mosaic: some features
(skeletal, dietary) establishing themselves quickly, others
developing later (toolmaking, language, use of fire). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A cluster of species developed about 2-2.5 million
years ago in Africa. <I>Homo</I> had a larger brain and a differently
shaped skull and teeth than the australopithecines. About 1.8 million
years ago, early <I>Homo</I> gave rise to <I>Homo erectus</I>, the
species thought to have been ancestral to our own. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Soon after its origin (1.8 million but probably
older than 2 million years ago) in Africa, <I>Homo erectus</I>
appears to have migrated out of Africa and into Europe and Asia.
<I>Homo erectus</I> differed from early species of <I>Homo</I> in
having a larger brain size, flatter face, and prominent brow ridges.
<I>Homo erectus</I> is similar to modern humans in size, but has some
differences in the shape of the skull, a receding chin, brow ridges,
and differences in teeth. <I>Homo erectus</I> was the first hominid

replaced by a new species, <I>Homo sapiens</I>. How, when and where
this new species arose and how it replaced its predecessor remain in
doubt.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Answering those questions has become a
multidisciplinary task.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Two hypotheses differ on how and where <I>Homo
sapiens</I> originated. </FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#out of Africa hypothesis"><FONT SIZE="+1">Out-of-Africa
   Hypothesis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> proposes that some <I>H.
   erectus</I> remained in Africa and continued to evolve into <I>H.
   sapiens</I>, and left Africa about 100,000-200,000 years ago. From
   a single source, <I>H. sapiens</I> replaced all populations of
   <I>H. erectus</I>. Human populations today are thus all descended
   from a single speciation event in Africa and should display a high
   degree of genetic similarity. Support for this hypothesis comes
   from DNA studies of mitochondria: since African populations
   display the greatest diversity of mitochondrial DNA, modern humans
   have been in Africa longer than they have been elsewhere.</FONT>
   <FONT SIZE="+1">Calculations suggest all modern humans are
   descended from a population of African <I>H. sapiens</I> numbering
   as few as 10,000. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">The Regional Continuity Hypothesis suggests
   that regional populations of <I>H. erectus</I> evolved into <I>H.
   sapiens</I> through interbreeding between the various populations.
   Evidence from the fossil record and genetic studies supports this
   idea. </FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Which hypothesis is correct?</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists can often use the same "evidence" to
support contrasting hypotheses depending on which evidence (fossils
or molecular clock/DNA studies) one gives more weight to. The
accuracy of the molecular clock, so key to the out-of-Africa
hypothesis, has recently been questioned.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Recent studies on the Y-chromosome seem to weaken the
regional continuity hypothesis by indicating a single point-of-origin
for our species some 270,000 years ago. Continued study will no doubt
reveal new evidence and undoubtedly new hypotheses will arise. It is
a task for all of us to weigh the evidence critically and reach a
supportable conclusion, whether we are scientists or not.</FONT></P>

</FONT><A HREF="BioBookHumEvol.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Back to
Top</FONT></A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Archaic <I>H. sapiens</I> lived from 500,000 to
30,000 years ago and combined features of <I>H. sapiens</I> with
those of <I>H. erectus</I>. The Neandertals, considered in this
group, lived in Europe and western Asia between 100,000 and 30,000
years ago before their disappearance. Neandertals were larger-brained
than modern humans, had a sloping forehead, prominent brow ridges and
a receding chin.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">They had a very prominent
nose and ranged in height from 5 foot 2 inches (average female) to 5
foot 6 inches (average male).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Despite their image as brutish simpletons,
Neandertals were the first humans to bury their dead with artifacts,
indicating abstract thought, perhaps a belief in an
after-life.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">They lived in free-standing
settlements, as well as caves.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">Neandertal
tools were more sophisticated than <I>H. erectus</I>' tools,
employing handles to gain extra leverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Did Neandertals evolve gradually into modern
humans, or were they replaced by modern forms originating from a
single population?</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The answer to that depends
on the answer to the question of the origin of <I>H. sapiens</I> from
<I>H. erectus</I>. The out-of-Africa hypothesis suggests Neandertals
were a separate species (<I>H. neandertalensis</I>) replaced as
modern humans (<I>H. sapiens</I>) spread from Africa.</FONT>

Neandertals were a subspecies (<I>H. sapiens neandertalensis</I>)
that evolved into modern humans (<I>H. sapiens

migrations have been a fact of human existence, helping to spread

recent innovations have not been physical, but rather
cultural.</FONT></P>

ones based on cultivation of plants and domesticated animals.
Evidence suggests this began in the Middle East and spread outward

migration of farmers into hunter-gatherer societies. This would
