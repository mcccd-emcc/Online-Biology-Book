All fungi, except the chytrids, lack flagella. Fungal reproduction

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Fungi are important both as a source of food and
in the preparation of food. Edible fungi include mushrooms, truffles,
and morels. Cheeses such as Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton, and bleu
have fungal colonies that give theses cheeses their distinctive
flavors. Beer and wine are produced through the action of fungi known
as yeasts, such as <I>Saccharomyces cerevisae</I>. Many antibiotics,
such as penicillin, are also produced by fungi. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Fungi also are important crop parasites, causing
loss of food plants, spoilage of food and some infectious diseases.
The 1972 U.S. corn crop was almost completely eradicated by a fungus.
Fungal parasites annually cause many billions of dollars in crop
damage and food spoilage.</FONT></P>

of Fungi | </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Back

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Over 60,000 species of fungi are known. Fungi are
classified by their method of reproduction (both sexual and asexual).
It seems likely that fungi are not a monophyletic group. Historically
they have been divided into four taxonomic divisions: Zygomycota,
Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Deuteromycota. The last group, the
Deuteromycota, are not a monophyletic group and thus have no standing
in a modern classification scheme. The modern systematic grouping
includes the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota, as well as
the Chytridiomycota.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Phylum Chytridiomycota include some of the
oldest fungal fossils (from the latest precambrian of Russia), as
well as the presence of flagellated gametes. Flagella are absent in
the cells of all other fungi. All but one group of this phylum has
chitin comprising their cell walls. Chytrids are aquatic, not
terrestrial as are almost all other fungi. They thus may provide us
with a glimpse of the earliest fungi, both in habit as well as
structure. This division also has quite a diverse arrayof body plans
and habitats. <I>Allomyces</I> is a chytrid used in some experiments.

stored grain that acts both as a toxin and the most deadly known

are parasites responsible for Dutch Elm disease and Chestnut blight.
Other sac fungi are used in commercial baking and brewing, wine

<I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </I>(sold as brewer's yeast or baker's
yeast). The latter fungus is useful to humans as a leavening agent in

asci. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Claviceps purpurea,</I> cause of the crop
disease known as wild ergot (or Jack-in-the-Rye), is a natural source
of the hallucenogen LSD. Some sholars speculate that an outbreak of
wild ergot may have been responsible for the hallucinations
associated with the Great Awakening in 17th century America. The
parasite causes the production of a long, dark purple spur (hence the
species name "purpurea") which contains the dormant fungus. During
this doimrant phase the fungus produces several defense chemicals
known as alkaloids, as well as lysegric acid and related compounds.
These latter compounds can cause the reported psychotrophic effects.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The deserts of the southwestern United States and
northern Mexico (as well as areas in South America) are home top an
endemic fungus,<I> Coccidioides immitis</I>, which causes a disease
in humans and animals known as valley fever. The disease, formally
known as coccidioidomycosis, usually begins as a respiratory
infection. In the most severe cases death results, although most
sufferers survive and are thought relatively immune for the remainder
of their lives. If diagnosed properly there are medical treatments
available. Rumors of the use of this organism as a bioweapon are
thought to be just rumors, due to the extreme care needed to grow and
work with this organism, whose infectious spores are approximately
the size of large bacteria. Those at higher risk from
<I>Coccidioides</I> include those with compromised immune systems
(AIDS patients, transplant recipients, diabetics), certain
ethnicities, and those whose work exposes them to desert soils at
certain times of the year. This fungus, whose sexual stage is unknown
at present, is of uncertain taxonomic placement: some structures look
like zygomycetes, but the ribosomal RNA data suggests this fungus is
an ascomycete. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Rusts and smuts are significant crop parasites:
corn smut almost destroyed the entire US corn crop in the 1970s.
During the late 1990s wheat fields in Arizona (yes, we did grow wheat
in the desert before all of the urban sprawl) had to be destroyed due
to the presence of karnal bunt fungus. Billions of dollars of food
crops worldwide are annually destroyed by these
basidiomycetes.</FONT></P>

between a photosynthetic organism (an alga or cyanobacterium) and a
fungus (either an ascomycete or a basidiomycete). Lichen often live
in marginal environments and often grow only one or two centimeters
per year. Historically this symbiosis has been considered an example
of mutualism, where both organisms benefit and neither is harmed by
their association. Organization of a typical lichen is shown in
Figure 9.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Lichens have long been recognized as useful
organisms for humans. Certain species of lichen are now recognized as
indicators of environmental pollution, other types of lichens have
been used to make natural dyes by indigenous poeople, or even to make
poison-tipped arrowheads. Because they often live in marginal
habitats, lichens have had to develop chemical defenses, making them
prime targets for natural antibiotic research. One estimate places
half of lichen species as possessing some sort of antibiotic
chemicals. Soe lichen are even edible, although many others are
harmful if eaten, so extreme caution should be used if investigating
edible fungi. </FONT></P>

both parties benefit. Fungi provide nutrients from the substrate, the

plant gets nutrients from the fungus in exchange for carbohydrates.
