<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scientific estimates place the origin of the
Universe at between 10 and 20 billion years ago. The theory currently
with the most acceptance is the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#big bang theory"><FONT SIZE="+1">Big
Bang Theory</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, the idea that all matter in
the Universe existed in a cosmic egg (smaller than the size of a
modern hydrogen atom) that exploded, forming the Universe. Recent
discoveries from the Space Telescope and other devices suggest this
theory smay need some modification. Evidence for the Big Bang
includes: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1">1) <B>The Red Shift</B>: when
   stars/galaxies are moving away from us the energy they emit is
   shifted to the red side of the visible-light spectrum. Those
   moving towards us are shifted to the violet side. This shift is an
   example of the Doppler effect. Similar effects are observed when
   listening to a train whistle-- it will sound higher (shorter
   wavelengths) approaching and lower (longer wavelengths) as it
   moves away. Likewise red wavelengths are longer than violet ones.
   Most galaxies appear to be moving away from ours. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1">2) <B>Background radiation</B>: two Bell Labs
   scientists discovered that in interstellar space there is a slight
   background radiation, thought to be the residual afterblast
   remnant of the Big Bang.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Soon after the Big Bang the major forces (such as
gravity, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, etc.)
differentiated. While in the cosmic egg, scientists think that matter
and energy as we understand them did not exist, but rather they
formed soon after the bang. After 10 million to 1 billion years the
universe became clumpy, with matter beginning to accumulate into
solar systems. One of those solar systems, ours, began to form
approximately 5 billion years ago, with a large "protostar" (that
became our sun) in the center. The planets were in orbits some
distance from the star, their increasing gravitational fields
sweeping stray debris into larger and larger planetesimals that
eventually formed planets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The processes of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#radioactive decay"><FONT SIZE="+1">radioactive
decay</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> and heat generated by the impact of
planetesimals heated the Earth, which then began to differentiate
into a "cooled" outer cooled crust (of silicon, oxygen and other
relatively light elements) and increasingly hotter inner areas
(composed of the heavier and denser elements such as iron and
nickel). Impact (asteroid, comet, planetismals) and the beginnings of
volcanism released water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and
other gases into a developing atmosphere. Sometime "soon" after this,
life on earth began. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Where did life originate and
how?</B></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Extra-terrestrial</B>: In 1969, a meteorite
(left-over bits from the origin of the solar system) landed near
Allende, Mexico. The Allende Meteorite (and others of its sort) have
been analyzed and found to contain </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#amino acids"><FONT SIZE="+1">amino

one of the four organic molecule groups basic to all life. The idea
of panspermia hypothesized that life originated out in space and came
to earth inside a meteorite. Recently, this idea has been revived as
Cosmic Ancestry. The amino acids recovered from meteorites are in a
group known as exotics: they do not occur in the chemical systems of
living things. The ET theory is now not considered by most scientists
to be correct, although the August 1996 discovery of the Martian
meteorite and its possible fossils have revived thought of life
elsewhere in the Solar System.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Supernatural</B>: Since science is an attempt
to measure and study the natural world, this theory is outside
science (at least our current understanding of science). Science
classes deal with science, and this idea is in the category of
not-science. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Organic Chemical Evolution</B>: Until the
mid-1800's scientists thought organic chemicals (those with a C-C
skeleton) could only form by the actions of living things. A French
scientist heated crystals of a mineral (a mineral is by definition
inorganic), and discovered that they formed urea (an organic
chemical) when they cooled. Russian scientist and academecian

The oldest known rocks on Earth are 3.96 billion years old and are

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The proximity of the earth to the sun, the make-up
of the earth's crust (silicate mixtures, presence of water, etc.) and
the size of the earth suggest we may be unique in our own solar
system, at least. Mars is smaller, farther from the sun, has a lower
gravitational field (which would keep the atmosphere from escaping
into space) and does show evidence of running water sometime in its
past. If life did start on Mars, however, there appears to be no life
(as we know it) today. Venus, the second planet, is closer to the
sun, and appears similar to earth in many respects. Carbon dioxide
build-up has resulted in a "greenhouse planet" with strong storms and
strongly acidic rain. Of all planets in the solar system, Venus is
most likely to have some form of C-based life. The outer planets are
as yet too poorly understood, although it seems unlikely that Jupiter
or Saturn harbor life as we know it. Like Goldilocks would say "Venus
is too hot, Mars is too cold, the Earth is just right!"</FONT></P>

inconclusive at best. The purported bacteria are much smaller than
any known bacteria on earth, were not hollow, and most could possibly
have been mineral in origin. However, many scientists consider that
the chemistry of life appears to have been established on Mars.
Search for Martian life (or its remains) continues.</FONT></P>

years old. The nature of this rock inducates that there were/are even
older rocks that, if they still exist, have yet to be located and
dated. Perhaps the biggest development during the Archean was the
first appearance of life. The earliest forms of life were simple
prokaryotic cells, in a few cases remarkably similar to living
prokaryotic forms (at least in terms of observable cell structure and
size). Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on earth earlier
than 3.5 billion years ago. Specimens from the North Pole region of
Western Australia are of such diversity and apparent complexity that
even more primitive cells must have existed earlier. Rocks of the

the development of oxygenic photosynthesis. This led to increasing
