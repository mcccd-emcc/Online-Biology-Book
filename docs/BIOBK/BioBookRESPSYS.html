Carbon dioxide is also generated by cellular </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#metabolism"><FONT SIZE="+1">metabolism</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

gases: carbon dioxide leaving the cell, oxygen entering. Animals have
organ systems involved in facilitating this exchange as well as the
transport of gases to and from exchange areas. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Body Surface</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Flatworms and annelids use their outer surfaces as
gas exchange surfaces. Earthworms have a series of thin-walled blood
vessels known as capillaries. Gas exchange occurs at capillaries
located throughout the body as well as those in the respiratory
surface. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Amphibians use their skin as a respiratory
surface. Frogs eliminate carbon dioxide 2.5 times as fast through
their skin as they do through their lungs. Eels (a fish) obtain 60%
of their oxygen through their skin. Humans exchange only 1% of their
carbon dioxide through their skin. Constraints of water loss dictate
that terrestrial animals must develop more efficient
lungs.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Gills</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Gills greatly increase the surface area for gas
exchange. They occur in a variety of animal groups including
arthropods (including some terrestrial crustaceans), annelids, fish,
and amphibians. Gills typically are convoluted outgrowths containing
blood vessels covered by a thin epithelial layer. Typically gills are
organized into a series of plates and may be internal (as in crabs
and fish) or external to the body (as in some amphibians).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Gills are very efficient at removing oxygen from
water: there is only 1/20 the amount of oxygen present in water as in
the same volume of air. Water flows over gills in one direction while
blood flows in the opposite direction through gill capillaries. This

are these tubes that carry air directly to cells for gas exchange.
Spiracles are openings at the body surface that lead to tracheae that
branch into smaller tubes known as tracheoles. Body movements or
contractions speed up the rate of diffusion of gases from tracheae
into body cells. However, tracheae will not function well in animals
whose body is longer than 5 cm. </FONT></P>
