<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Biology literally means "the study of life".
Biology is such a broad field, covering the minute workings of
chemical machines inside our cells, to broad scale concepts of
ecosystems and global climate change. Biologists study intimate
details of the human brain, the composition of our genes, and even
the functioning of our reproductive system. Biologists recently all
but completed the deciphering of the human genome, the sequence of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases that may determine much of our
innate capabilities and predispositions to certain forms of behavior
and illnesses. DNA sequences have played major roles in criminal
cases (O.J. Simpson, as well as the reversal of death penalties for
many wrongfully convicted individuals), as well as the impeachment of
President Clinton (the stain at least did not lie). We are bombarded
with headlines about possible health risks from favorite foods
(Chinese, Mexican, hamburgers, etc.) as well as the potential
benefits of eating other foods such as cooked tomatoes. Informercials
tout the benefits of metabolism-adjusting drugs for weight loss. Many
Americans are turning to herbal remedies to ease arthritis pain,
improve memory, as well as improve our moods. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Can a biology book give you the answers to these
questions? No, but it will enable you learn how to sift through the
biases of investigators, the press, and others in a quest to
critically evaluate the question. To be honest, five years after you
are through with this class it is doubtful you would remember all the
details of meatbolism. However, you will know where to look and maybe
a little about the process of science that will allow you to make an
informed decision. Will you be a scientist? Yes, in a way. You may
not be formally trained as a science major, but you can think
critically, solve problems, and have some idea about what science can
and cannoit do. I hope you will be able to tell the shoe from the
shinola. </FONT></P>

<H2><A NAME="Science and the scientific meth"></A>Science and the
Scientific Method | <A HREF="#Table of Contents">Back to Top</A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Science is an objective, logical, and repeatable
attempt to understand the principles and forces operating in the
natural universe. Science is from the Latin word, <I>scientia</I>, to
know. Good science is <B>not</B> dogmatic, but should be viewed as an
ongoing process of testing and evaluation. One of the hoped-for
benefits of students taking a biology course is that they will become
more familiar with the process of science. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Humans seem innately interested in the world we
live in. Young children drive their parents batty with constant "why"
questions. Science is a means to get some of those whys answered.
When we shop for groceries, we are conducting a kind of scientific
experiment. If you like Brand X of soup, and Brand Y is on sale,
perhaps you try Brand Y. If you like it you may buy it again, even
when it is not on sale. If you did not like Brand Y, then no sale
will get you to try it again. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In order to conduct science, one must know the
rules of the game (imagine playing <U>Monopoly</U> and having to
discover the rules as you play! Which is precisely what one does with
some computer or videogames (before buying the cheatbook). The
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#scientific method"><FONT SIZE="+1">scientific
method</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is to be used as a guide that can
be modified. In some sciences, such as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#taxonomy"><FONT SIZE="+1">taxonomy</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
and certain types of geology, laboratory experiments are not
necessarily performed. Instead, after formulating a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hypothesis"><FONT SIZE="+1">hypothesis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
additional observations and/or collections are made from different
localities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Steps in the scientific method commonly include:
</FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Observation: defining the problem you wish to
   explain. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Hypothesis: one or more falsifiable
   explanations for the observation. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Experimentation: Controlled attempts to test
   one or more hypotheses. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Conclusion: was the hypothesis supported or
   not? After this step the hypothesis is either modified or
   rejected, which causes a repeat of the steps above.</FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">After a hypothesis has been repeatedly tested, a
hierarchy of scientific thought develops. Hypothesis is the most
common, with the lowest level of certainty. A </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#theory"><FONT SIZE="+1">theory</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested with little
modification, e.g. The Theory of Evolution. A Law is one of the
fundamental underlying principles of how the Universe is organized,
e.g. The Laws of Thermodynamics, Newton's Law of Gravity. Science
uses the word theory differently than it is used in the general
population. Theory to most people, in general nonscientific use, is
an untested idea. Scientists call this a hypothesis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scientific experiments are also concerned with
isolating the variables. A good science experiment does not
simultaneously test several variables, but rather a single variable
that can be measured against a control. Scientific controlled
experiments are situations where all factors are the same between two
test subjects, except for the single experimental variable.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Consider a commonly conducted science fair
experiment. Sandy wants to test the effect of gangsta rap music on
pea plant growth. She plays loud rap music 24 hours a day to a series
of pea plants grown under light, and watered every day. At the end of
her experiment she concludes gangsta rap is conducive to plant
growth. Her teacher grades her project very low, citing the lack of a
control group for the experiment. Sandy returns to her experiment,
but this time she has a separate group of plants under the same
conditions as the rapping plants, but with soothing Led Zeppelin
songs playing. She comes to the same conclusion as before, but now
has a basis for comparison. Her teacher gives her project a better
grade. </FONT></P>

Latin for chambers. Mattias Schleiden (in 1838) concluded all plant
tissues consisted of cells. In 1839, Theodore Schwann came to a
similar conclusion for animal tissues. Rudolf Virchow, in 1858,
combined the two ideas and added that all cells come from
pre-existing cells, formulating the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cell theory"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cell

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">These first three theories are very accepted by
scientists and the general public. The theory of evolution is well
accepted by scientists and most of the general public. However, it
remains a lightening rod for school boards, politicians, and
television preachers. Much of this confusion results from what the
theory says and what it does not say. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Modern biology is based on several unifying
themes, such as the cell theory, genetics and inheritance, Francis
Crick's central dogma of information flow, and Darwin and Wallace's
theory of evolution by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#natural selection"><FONT SIZE="+1">natural
selection</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. In this first unit we will
examine these themes and the nature of science.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Ancient Greek philosopher Anaxiamander
(611-547 B.C.) and the Roman philosopher Lucretius (99-55 B.C.)
coined the concept that all living things were related and that they
had changed over time. The classical science of their time was
observational rather than experimental. Another ancient Greek
philosopher, </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Aristotle</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
developed his <I>Scala Naturae</I>, or Ladder of Life, to explain his
concept of the advancement of living things from inanimate matter to
plants, then animals and finally man. This concept of man as the
"crown of creation" still plagues modern evolutionary biologists (See
Gould, 1989, for a more detailed discussion).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Post-Aristotlean "scientists" were constrained by
the prevailing thought patterns of the Middle Ages -- the inerrancy
of the biblical book of Genesis and the special creation of the world
in a literal six days of the 24-hour variety. Archbishop James Ussher
of Ireland, in the late 1600's calculated the age of the earth based
on the geneologies from Adam and Eve listed in the biblical book of
Genesis. According to Ussher's calculations, the earth was formed on
October 22, 4004 B.C. These calculations were part of Ussher's book,
<U>History of the World</U>. The chronology he developed was taken as
factual, and was even printed in the front pages of bibles. Ussher's
ideas were readily accepted, in part because they posed no threat to
the social order of the times; comfortable ideas that would not upset
the linked applecarts of church and state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Often new ideas must "come out of left field",
appearing as wild notions, but in many cases prompting investigation
which may later reveal the "truth". Ussher's ideas were comfortable,
the Bible was viewed as correct, therefore the earth <B>must</B> be
only 5000 years old.</FONT></P>

the basis of modern geology and paleontology. According to Hutton's
work, certain geological processes operated in the past in much the
same fashion as they do today, with minor exceptions of rates, etc.
Thus many geological structures and processes cannot be explained if
the earth was only a mere 5000 years old.</FONT></P>

among other things, the length of the giraffe neck. The Lamarckian
view is that modern giraffe's have long necks because their ancestors
progressively gained longer necks due to stretching to reach food
higher and higher in trees. According to the 19th century concept of
use and disuse the stretching of necks resulted in their development,
which was somehow passed on to their progeny. Today we realize that
only bacteria are able to incorporate non-genetic (nonheritable)
traits. Lamarck's work was a theory that plainly stated that life had
changed over time and provided (albeit an erroneous) mechanism of
change. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Unlike the upper-class Darwin, </FONT><A HREF="http://www.biography.com/cgi-bin/biography/biography-request.pl?page=/biography/data/W/W.14295.txt.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Alfred
Russel Wallace</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (1823-1913) came from a
different social class. Wallace spent many years in South America,
publishing salvaged notes in <B>Travels on the Amazon and Rio
Negro</B> in 1853. In 1854, Wallace left England to study the natural
history of Indonesia, where he contracted malaria. During a fever
Wallace managed to write down his ideas on natural
selection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1858, Darwin received a letter from Wallace, in
which Darwin's as-yet-unpublished theory of evolution and adaptation
was precisely detailed. Darwin arranged for Wallace's letter to be
read at a scientific meeting, along with a synopsis of his own ideas.
To be correct, we need to mention that both Darwin and Wallace
developed the theory, although Darwin's major work was not published
until 1859 (the book </FONT><A HREF="http://www.literature.org/Works/Charles-Darwin/origin/"><FONT SIZE="+1">On
the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, considered by many as one of
the most influential books written &#91;follow the hyperlink to view
an online version&#93;). While there have been some changes to the
theory since 1859, most notably the incorporation of genetics and DNA
into what is termed the "Modern Synthesis" during the 1940's, most
scientists today acknowledge evolution as the guiding theory for
modern biology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Recent revisions of biology curricula stressed the
need for underlying themes. Evolution serves as such a universal
theme. An excellent site devoted to Darwin's thoughts and work is
available by clicking </FONT><A HREF="http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/hypertext/landow/victorian/darwin/darwinov.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.

<H2><A NAME="Characteristics of living thing"></A>Characteristics of
living things | <A HREF="#Table of Contents">Back to Top</A></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Living things have a variety of common
characteristics.</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Organization</B>. Living things exhibit a
   high level of organization, with multicellular organisms being
   subdivided into cells, and cells into organelles, and organelles
   into molecules, etc.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#homeostasis"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Homeostasis</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
   Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant (yet also dynamic)
   internal environment in terms of temperature, pH, water
   concentrations, etc. Much of our own metabolic energy goes toward
   keeping within our own homeostatic limits. If you run a high fever
   for long enough, the increased temperature will damage certain
   organs and impair your proper functioning. Swallowing of common
   household chemicals, many of which are outside the
   </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pH"><FONT SIZE="+1">pH</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (acid/base) levels we can tolerate, will likewise negatively
   impact the human body's homeostatic regime. Muscular activity
   generates heat as a waste product. This heat is removed from our
   bodies by sweating. Some of this heat is used by warm-blooded
   animals, mammals and birds, to maintain their internal
   temperatures.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Adaptation</B>. Living things are suited to
   their mode of existence. Charles Darwin began the recognition of
   the marvellous adaptations all life has that allow those organisms
   to exist in their environment. </FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Reproduction and heredity</B>. Since all
   cells come from existing cells, they must have some way of
   reproducing, whether that involves </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#asexual reproduction"><FONT SIZE="+1">asexual</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (no recombination of genetic material) or </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sexual reproduction"><FONT SIZE="+1">sexual</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (recombination of genetic material). Most living things use the
   chemical DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) as the physical carrier of
   inheritance and the genetic information. Some organisms, such as
   </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#retroviruses"><FONT SIZE="+1">retroviruses</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (of which </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#human immunodeficiency virus (H"><FONT SIZE="+1">HIV</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   is a member), use RNA (ribonucleic acid) as the carrier. The
   variation that Darwin and Wallace recognized as the wellspring of
   evolution and adaptation, is greatly increased by sexual
   reproduction.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Growth and development</B>. Even
   single-celled organisms grow. When first formed by cell division,
   they are small, and must grow and develop into mature cells.
   Multicellular organisms pass through a more complicated process of
   differentiation and organogenesis (because they have so many more
   cells to develop).</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Energy acquisition and release</B>. One
   view of life is that it is a struggle to acquire energy (from
   sunlight, inorganic chemicals, or another organism), and release
   it in the process of forming </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#adenosine triphosphate (ATP)"><FONT SIZE="+1">ATP
   (adenosine triphosphate)</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Detection and response to
   </B></FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#stimulus"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>stimuli</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (both internal and external).</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Interactions</B>. Living things interact
   with their environment as well as each other. Organisms obtain raw
   materials and energy from the environment or another organism. The
   various types of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#symbiosis"><FONT SIZE="+1">symbioses</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
   (organismal interactions with each other) are examples of this.
   </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Levels of Organization"></A>Levels of Organization |
<A HREF="#Table of Contents">Back to Top</A></H2>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#biosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">Biosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The sum of all living things taken in conjunction with their
environment. In essence, where life occurs, from the upper reaches of
the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to the bottoms of the
oceans. We divide the earth into </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#atmosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">atmosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
(air), </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#lithosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">lithosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
(earth), </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#hydrosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">hydrosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
(water), and biosphere (life).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ecosystem: The relationships of a smaller groups
of organisms with each other and their environment. Scientists often
speak of the interrelatedness of living things. Since, according to
Darwin's theory, organisms adapt to their environment, they must also
adapt to other organisms in that environment. We can discuss the flow
of energy through an ecosystem from photosynthetic autotrophs to
herbivores to carnivores.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#community"><FONT SIZE="+1">Community</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
The relationships between groups of different species. For example,
the desert communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds,
mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus (<I>Carnegia gigantea</I>),
Ocotillo, creosote bush, etc. Community structure can be disturbed by
such things as fire, human activity, and over-population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Species: Groups of similar individuals who tend to
mate and produce viable, fertile offspring. We often find species
described not by their reproduction (a biological species) but rather
by their form (anatomical or form species).</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#population"><FONT SIZE="+1">Populations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate with each other in a
limited geographic area. This can be as simple as a field of flowers,
which is separated from another field by a hill or other area where
none of these flowers occur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Individuals: One or more cells characterized by a
unique arrangement of DNA "information". These can be unicellular or
multicellular. The multicellular individual exhibits specialization
of cell types and division of labor into tissues, organs, and organ
systems.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#organ systems"><FONT SIZE="+1">Organ
System</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">: (in multicellular organisms). A
group of cells, tissues, and organs that perform a specific major
function. For example: the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cardiovascular system"><FONT SIZE="+1">cardiovascular
system</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> functions in circulation of
blood.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#organs"><FONT SIZE="+1">Organ</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
(in multicellular organisms). A group of cells or tissues performing
an overall function. For example: the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#heart"><FONT SIZE="+1">heart</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is an organ that pumps blood within the cardiovascular
system.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#tissues"><FONT SIZE="+1">Tissue</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">:
(in multicellular organisms). A group of cells performing a specific
function. For example </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cardiac muscle"><FONT SIZE="+1">heart
muscle tissue</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is found in the heart and
its unique contraction properties aid the heart's functioning as a
pump. .</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME=Cell></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Cell: The fundamental unit of
living things. Each cell has some sort of hereditary material (either
DNA or more rarely RNA), energy acquiring chemicals, structures, etc.
Living things, by definition, must have the metabolic chemicals plus
a nucleic acid hereditary information molecule.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Organelle: A subunit of a cell, an organelle is
involved in a specific subcellular function, for example the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#ribosomes"><FONT SIZE="+1">ribosome</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
