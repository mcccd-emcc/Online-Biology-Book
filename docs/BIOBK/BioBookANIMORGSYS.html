<P><font size="+1">We are all familiar with many of the organ systems that comprise the body of advanced animals: such as the circulatory system, nervous system, etc. More of us are aware of the essential nature of the immune system in these days of HIV, AIDS, and emergent viral diseases such as  Ebola and Hanta. Later chapters will focus on animals, such as sponges that have no organs at all, and other organisms that  lack many of the organ systems we take for granted. Recall that in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Introduction</a> chapter we discussed the levels of organization we see in biology, from atoms to organ systems that makeup a multicellular organism. We have also seen somewhat of the myriad cells and tissues that occur in humans (and by extension in other animals). This chapter will introduce you to the eleven organ systems that function within our own bodies, and how they coordinate to keep us functioning within a dynamic range of internal conditions we refer to as homeostasis.</font></P>
<P><font size="+1"><br>
  Animal organs are usually composed of more than one cell type. Recall  that the stomach contains all four animal tissue types: epithelium to line the stomach and secrete gastric juices; connective tissues to give the stomach flexibility to expand after a large meal; smooth muscle tissues to churn and digest that meal without the need for conscious thought (indeed, we are aware of that action only when we burp or suffer some sort of gastric distress!); and nervous tissues to monitor the progress of food as it is worked on by the stomach, and to direct secretion and muscle activity. Each organ typically performs a given function set. The stomach is an organ composed of tissues that aid in the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food. Most organs have functions in only one organ system. The stomach is involved only in the digestion of food as part of the digestive system. Organ systems, such as the digestive system, are collections of organs that perform a major function for the organism.</font></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#homeostasis"><FONT SIZE="+1">Homeostasis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Homeostasis is a
term coined in 1959 to describe the physical and chemical parameters
that an organism must maintain to allow proper functioning of its
component cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. </FONT></P>
<P><font size="+1">Recall  that enzymes function best when within a certain range of temperature and pH, and  that cells must strive to maintain a balance between having too much or too little water in relation to their external environment. Both situations  demonstrate  homeostasis. Just as we have a certain temperature range (or comfort zone), so  our body has a range of environmental (internal as well as external) parameters within which it works best. &nbsp;Multicellular organisms accomplish this by having organs and organ systems that coordinate their homeostasis. In addition to the other functions that life must perform (recall the discussion in our Introduction chapter), unicellular creatures must accomplish their homeostasis within but a single cell!</font></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Single-celled
  organisms are surrounded by their external environment. They   move materials into and out of the cell by regulation of the cell membrane and its functioning. Most
  multicellular organisms have most of their cells protected from the
  external environment, having them surrounded by an aqueous internal
  environment. This internal environment must be maintained in such a
  state as to allow maximum efficiency. The ultimate control of
  homeostasis is done by the nervous system. Often this control is in
  the form of negative feedback loops. Heat control is a major function
  of homeostatic conditions that involves the integration of skin,
  muscular, nervous, and circulatory systems.</FONT></P>
<P><font size="+1">The difference between homeostasis as a single cell performs it and what a multicelled creature does derives from  their basic organizational plan: a single cell can dump wastes outside the cell and just be done with it. Cells in a multicelled creature, such as a human or cat, also dump wastes outside those cells, but like the trash can or dumpster outside my house/apartment, those wastes must be carted away. The carting away of these wastes is accomplished in my body by the circulatory system in conjunction with the excretory system. For my house, I have the City of Phoenix sanitation department do that (and get to pay each month for their service!). </font></P>
<P><font size="+1">The ultimate control of homeostasis is accomplished by the nervous system (for rapid responses such as reflexes to avoid picking up a hot pot off the stove) and the endocrine system (for longer-term responses, such as maintaining the body levels of calcium, etc.). Often this homeostatic control takes the form of negative feedback loops. There are two types of biological feedback: positive and negative. Negative feedback turns off the stimulus that caused it in the first place. Your house&rsquo;s heater (or cooler for those of us in the Sun Belt) acts on the principle of negative feedback. When your house cools off below the temperature set by your thermostat, the heater is turned on to warm air until the temperature is at or above what the thermostat is set at. The thermostat detects this rise in temperature and sends a signal to shut off the heater, allowing the house to cool of until the heater is turned on yet again and the cycle (or loop) continues. Positive feedback causes an amplification of the stimulus by the reaction. Examples of each will be presented below. </font></P>

as a light switch. Closed Systems has two components: a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#sensor"><FONT SIZE="+1">sensor</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
and an </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#effector"><FONT SIZE="+1">effector</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
such as a thermostat (sensor) and furnace (effector). Most
physiological systems in the body use feedback to maintain the body's
internal environment. </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Extrinsic</FONT></H4></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most homeostatic systems are extrinsic: they are
controlled from outside the body. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#endocrine system"><FONT SIZE="+1">Endocrine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#nervous system"><FONT SIZE="+1">nervous</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
systems are the major control systems in higher animals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The nervous system depends on sensors in the skin
or sensory organs to receive stimuli and transmit a message to the
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#spinal cord"><FONT SIZE="+1">spinal
cord</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> or brain. Sensory input is processed
and a signal is sent to an effector system, such as muscles or
glands, that effects the response to the stimulus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The endocrine system is the second type of
extrinsic control, and involves a chemical component to the reflex.
Sensors detect a change within the body and send a message to an
endocrine effector (parathyroid), which makes PTH. PTH is released
into the blood when blood calcium levels are low. PTH causes bone to
release calcium into the bloodstream, raising the blood calcium
levels and shutting down the production of PTH.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Some reflexes have a combination of nervous and
endocrine response. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxin (which
controls the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#metabolism"><FONT SIZE="+1">metabolic</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
rate) into the bloodstream. Falling levels of thyroxin stimulate
receptors in the brain to signal the hypothalamus to release a
hormone that acts on the pituitary gland to release </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#thyroid-stimulating hormone"><FONT SIZE="+1">thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH)</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> into the blood. TSH acts on
the thyroid, causing it to increase production of thyroxin.
</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Intrinsic</FONT></H4></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Local, or intrinsic, controls usually involve only
one organ or tissue. When muscles use more oxygen, and also produce
more carbon dioxide, intrinsic controls cause dilation of the blood
vessels allowing more blood into those active areas of the muscles.
Eventually the vessels will return to "normal".</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#negative feedback control"><FONT SIZE="+1">Negative
feedback control mechanisms</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (used by most
of the body's systems) are called negative because the information
caused by the feedback causes a reverse of the response. TSH is an
example: blood levels of TSH serve as feedback for production of
TSH.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#positive feedback control"><FONT SIZE="+1">Positive
feedback control</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is used in some cases.
Input increases or accelerates the response. During uterine
contractions, </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossO.html#oxytocin"><FONT SIZE="+1">oxytocin</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is produced. Oxytocin causes an increase in frequency and strength of
uterine contractions. This in turn causes further production of
oxytocin, etc. </FONT></P>

   Skin is waterproof because keratin, a protein is produced. The
