<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It can be quite correctly argued that life exists
on Earth because of the abundant liquid water. Other planets have
water, but they either have it as a gas (Venus) or ice (Mars). This
relationship is shown in Figure 1. Recent studies of Mars reveal the
presence sometime in the past of running fluid, possibly water. The
chemical nature of water is thus one we must examine as it permeates
living systems: water is a universal solvent, and can be too much of
a good thing for some cells to deal with.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Water has been referred to as the universal
<A NAME=solvent></A>solvent. Living things are composed of atoms and
molecules within aqueous solutions (solutions that have materials
dissolved in water). Solutions are uniform mixtures of the molecules
of two or more substances. The solvent is usually the substance
present in the greatest amount (and is usually also a liquid). The
substances of lesser amounts are the solutes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The solubility of many molecules is determined by
their molecular structure. You are familiar with the phrase "mixing
like oil and water." The biochemical basis for this phrase is that

(of which fats are an important, although often troublesome, group)
have areas that lack polar covalent bonds. The polar covalently
bonded water molecules act to exclude nonpolar molecules, causing the
fats to clump together. The structure of many molecules can greatly
influence their solubility. Sugars, such as glucose, have many
hydroxyl (OH) groups, which tend to increase the solubility of the
molecule. This aspect of water is illustrated in Figure 4.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The pH scale is a logarithmic scale representing
the concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> ions in a solution. Remember that
as the H<SUP>+</SUP> concentration increases the OH<SUP>-</SUP>
concentration decreases and <I>vice versa </I>. If we have a solution
with one in every ten molecules being H<SUP>+</SUP>, we refer to the
concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> ions as 1/10. Remember from algebra
that we can write a fraction as a negative exponent, thus 1/10
becomes 10<SUP>-1</SUP>. Conversely 1/100 becomes 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ,
1/1000 becomes 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, etc. Logarithms are exponents to
which a number (usually 10) has been raised. For example log 10
(pronounced "the log of 10") = 1 (since 10 may be written as
10<SUP>1</SUP>). The log 1/10 (or 10<SUP>-1</SUP>) = -1. pH, a
measure of the concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> ions, is the negative
log of the H<SUP>+</SUP> ion concentration. If the pH of water is 7,
then the concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> ions is 10<SUP>-7</SUP>, or
1/10,000,000. In the case of strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid
(HCl), an acid secreted by the lining of your stomach,
&#91;H<SUP>+</SUP>&#93; (the concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> ions,
written in a chemical shorthand) is 10<SUP>-1</SUP>; therefore the pH
is 1.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Organic molecules are those that: 1) formed by the
actions of living things; and/or 2) have a carbon backbone. Methane
(CH<SUB>4</SUB>) is an example of this. If we remove the H from one
of the methane units below, and begin linking them up, while removing
other H units, we begin to form an organic molecule. (NOTE: Not all
methane is organically derived, methane is a major component of the
atmosphere of Jupiter, which we think is devoid of life). When two
methanes are combined, the resultant molecule is Ethane, which has a
chemical formula C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>. Molecules made up of H
and C are known as hydrocarbons. The formulas and structural
representations of several simple organic molecules are shown in

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists eventually realized that specific
chemical properties were a result of the presence of particular
functional groups. Functional groups are clusters of atoms with
characteristic structure and functions. Polar molecules (with +/-
charges) are attracted to water molecules and are hydrophilic.
Nonpolar molecules are repelled by water and do not dissolve in
water; are hydrophobic. Hydrocarbon is hydrophobic except when it has
an attached ionized functional group such as carboxyl (acid) (COOH),
then molecule is hydrophilic. Since cells are 70-90% water, the
degree to which organic molecules interact with water affects their
function. One of the most common groups is the -OH (hydroxyl) group.
Its presence will enable a molecule to be water soluble.</FONT></P>

bond with up to four other atoms (usually H, O, N, or another C).
Since carbon can make covalent bonds with another carbon atom, carbon

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Each organic molecule group has small molecules

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Macromolecules are constructed by covalently
bonding monomers by condensation reactions where water is removed
from functional groups on the monomers. Cellular enzymes carry out
condensation (and the reversal of the reaction, hydrolysis of
polymers). Condensation involves a dehydration synthesis because a
water is removed (dehydration) and a bond is made (synthesis). When
two monomers join, a hydroxyl (OH) group is removed from one monomer
and a hydrogen (H) is removed from the other. This produces the water
given off during a condensation reaction. Hydrolysis (hydration)
reactions break down polymers in reverse of condensation; a hydroxyl
(OH) group from water attaches to one monomer and hydrogen (H)
attaches to the other. </FONT></P>

are large molecules composed of individual monosaccharide units. A
common plant polysaccharide is starch (shown in Figure 12), which is
made up of many glucoses (in a polypeptide these are referred to as
glucans). Two forms of polysaccharide, amylose and amylopectin makeup
what we commonly call starch. The formation of the ester bond by
condensation (the removal of water from a molecule) allows the
linking of monosaccharides into disaccharides and polysaccharides.
Glycogen (see Figure 12) is an animal storage product that
accumulates in the vertebrate liver. </FONT></P>

(beyond their glycogen storage capacities) into fats. Most plants
store excess sugars as starch, although some seeds and fruits have
energy stored as oils (e.g. corn oil, peanut oil, palm oil, canola
oil, and sunflower oil). Fats yield 9.3 Kcal/gm, while carbohydrates
yield 3.79 Kcal/gm. Fats thus store six times as much energy as
glycogen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Diets are attempts to reduce the amount of fats
present in specialized cells known as adipose cells that accumulate
in certain areas of the human body. By restricting the intakes of
carbohydrates and fats, the body is forced to draw on its own stores
to makeup the energy debt. The body responds to this by lowering its
metabolic rate, often resulting in a drop of "energy level."
Successful diets usually involve three things: decreasing the amounts
of carbohydrates and fats; exercise; and behavior modification.

shown in Figure 22, consist of a sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a
phosphate. The sugars are either ribose or deoxyribose. They differ
by the lack of one oxygen in deoxyribose. Both are pentoses usually
in a ring form. There are five nitrogenous bases. Purines (Adenine
