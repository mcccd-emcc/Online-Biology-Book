Humans are coelomates, since we have an abdomenal cavity containing
digestive organs, some of the excretory and reproductive organs, and
a thoracic cavity that contains the heart and lungs. Coelomates also
form a variety of internal and external skeletons. External skeletons
and coeloms appeared during the Cambrian-Ordovician time. These
skeletons offered several advantages to their producers:</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Classification of Echinodermata</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There are several taxonomic classes of echinoderms
of varying familarity to the general public.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Crinoidea</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Crinoidea includes about 600 species of
crinoids, the stalked sea "lilies" and the motile feather stars.
Their branched arms are used for filter-feeding and give the animals
a flowerlike or plantlike appearance (hence the term sea lily).
Crinoid stalks and blastoid heads are common fossils in certain parts
of North America. </FONT></P>

cucumbers. Sorry, these are NOT good eating as a general rule!
Holothuroideans have a long leathery body, and feed by tentacles
located around their mouth.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Echinoidea</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Scientists generally place about 950 species of
sea urchins and sand dollars are in the class Echinoidea. Both sea
urchins and sand dollars have spines thar they use for locomotion,
defense, and burrowing. Sea urchins have long, blunt spines. Sand
dollars are flattened with a five-part flowerlike pattern of pores
for skin projections.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Ophiuroidea</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Ophiuroidea consists of approximately
2,000 species of brittle stars. Brittle stars have a central disk
from which long, flexible arms radiate. These long arms allow them to
move rapidly.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The Class Asteroidea</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The class Asteroidea contains about 1,500 species
of sea stars (commonly known as starfishes). Most starfish have a
dorsoventrally flattened body. Starfish have a central disk to which
five, or a multiple of five, sturdy arms are attached. Sea stars are
common along rocky coasts where they eat clams, oysters, and other
bivalves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The five-rayed body has an oral (mouth) and aboral
(upper) side. Spines project from the endoskeletal plate through the
thin dermis. Pincerlike pedicellarie keep the surface free from
particles. Gas exchange is conducted by skin gills. On the oral
surface, each arm has a groove lined with tube feet. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A sea star feeds by everting its stomach. It
positions itself over a bivalve and attaches tube feet to each side
of the shell. By working tube feet in an alternating fashion, it
opens the shell open. Only a small crack is needed to insert its
cardiac stomach into the prey. Stomach enzymes begin digesting the
bivalve as it is trying to close its shell. Partially digested food
is then taken into the pyloric stomach for complete digestion. A
short intestine opens at the anus on the aboral side.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Each arm has a well-developed coelom containing a
pair of digestive glands and male or female gonads. The nervous
system is a central ring with radial nerves in each arm. A
light-sensitive </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#eyespot"><FONT SIZE="+1">eyespot</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is at the end of each arm, facilitating coordinated but slow
responses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Locomotion depends upon the water vascular system.
Water enters on the aboral side through the sieve plate, which is
also known as the madreporite. Water passes through a stone canal to
a ring canal and into the radial canals in each arm. The radial
canals feed into lateral canals extending into tube feet, each of
which has an ampulla. Contraction of an ampulla forces water into the
tube foot, expanding it; when the foot touches a surface, the center
withdraws forming a suction and adhering to surfaces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Echinoderms lack complex respiratory, excretory,
and circulatory systems. Fluids within the coelomic cavity carry out
the function of diffusing substances and gases. Gas exchange occurs
across the skin gills and tube feet. Nitrogenous wastes diffuse
through coelomic fluid and across the body wall. Cilia on the
peritoneum lining the coelom keep the coelomic fluid
moving.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Sea stars reproduce both sexually and asexually.
If the body is fragmented, each fragment can regenerate a whole
animal. Sea stars spawn and release either eggs or sperm at the same
time. The bilateral larvae undergoes a metamorphosis to become a
radially symmetrical adult. </FONT></P>

<H2><A NAME="Phylum Hemichordata"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Phylum
Hemichordata | </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Back

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Phylum Hemichordata includes about 90 species
of acorn worms. Some acorn worms living on tidal mud flats have a
proboscis, a collar, and a trunk. The dorsal nerve cord in the collar
and trunk resembles the nerve cord of chordates. The pharynx below
the collar has gill slits. Larva of hemichordates resembles the larva
of echinoderms. These facts cause some scientists to believe
echinoderms and hemichordates share a common ancestor and that
hemichordates and chordates are related by a common
ancestor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hemichordates are classified into three classes,
two with living members, one consisting of only fossil forms. The
Enteropneusta includes the acorn worms; the Pterobranchia includes 20
species of colonial bottom dwelling worms. The fossil (extinct)
group, the Graptolithina (graptolites), are common fossils in the
Ordovician and Silurian. They have recently been placed in this
phylum. </FONT></P>

In the invertebrate chordates, fish, and amphibian larvae, pharyngeal
gill pouches become functioning gills. Terrestrial vertebrates have
their pouches modified for various purposes; in humans, the first
pouches become the auditory tubes, the second become tonsils, and the
third and fourth pairs become the thymus and parathyroid
glands.</FONT></P>

echinoderms and chordates share a common ancestry. Although scanty,
fossil finds from the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#Cambrian"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cambrian</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Invertebrate Chordates</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Not all chordates are vertebrates. Some chordates
are invertebrates, lacking a vertebral column. In these invertebrate
chordates, the notochord persists and is never replaced by the
vertebral column. </FONT></P>

<H4><A NAME="Subphylum Urochordata"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Subphylum
Urochordata</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The subphylum Urochordata contains 1,250 species
of tunuicates that have gill slits. Adults have a body composed of an
outer tunic with an incurrent and excurrent siphon. When they are
disturbed, tunicates tend to squirt water out. Water passes into a
pharynx and out numerous gill slits, the only chordate characteristic
that remains in adults. Microscopic particles adhere to a mucous
secretion in the pharynx and are eaten. The larvae are bilaterally
symmetrical and have the three chordate characteristics. Tunicate
larva metamorphose into the sessile adult. Beating of numerous cilia
lining the inside of the pharynx creates a current to move water
through a tunicate. Some suggest larvae became sexually mature
without developing tunicate characteristics; thus, a urochordate
larva was ancestral to vertebrates; or a cephalochordate larva may
have been ancestral to vertebrates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The lancelets have three chordate characteristics.
The 23 species of lancelets are in the genus <I>Branchiostoma</I> in
the subphylum Cephalochordata. Their elongated, lance-shaped body
resembles the lancelet, a two-edged surgical knife. They inhabit
shallow coastal waters; they lie partly buried in sandy substrates
and filter feed. Lancelets feed on microscopic particles filtered
from the constant stream of water that enters the mouth and exits
through the gill slits into an atrium that opens at the atriopore.
Lancelets retain the three chordate characteristics as an adult. The
notochord extends from head to tail, accounting for the name
"Cephalochordata." Lancelets have segmented muscles and their dorsal
hollow nerve cord has periodic branches.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Vertebrate Chordates</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The vertebrates comprise a large group of
chordates, and are subdivided into seven classes (3 classes of fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals).</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Vertebrates have an internal skeleton of cartilage or
bone, with vertebrae surrounding the dorsal nerve cord.</FONT></P>

<H4><A NAME="Subphylum Vertebrata"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Subphylum
Vertebrata</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The subphylum Vertebrata consists of about 43,700
species of animals with backbones. Vertebrates exhibit all three of
the chordate characteristics at some point during their lives. The
embryonic notochord is replaced by a vertebral column in the adult.
The vertebral column is made of individual hard segments
(</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossV.html#vertebrae"><FONT SIZE="+1">vertebrae</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)
surrounding the dorsal hollow nerve cord. The nerve cord is the one
chordate feature present in the adult phase of <B>all</B>
vertebrates. The vertebral column, part of a flexible but strong
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#endoskeleton"><FONT SIZE="+1">endoskeleton</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
is evidence that vertebrates are segmented. The vertebrate skeleton
is living tissue (either cartilage or bone) that grows as the animal
grows. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The endoskeleton and muscles form an organ system
(the musculoskeletal system) that permits rapid and efficient
movement. The pectoral and pelvic fins of fishes evolved into jointed
appendages that allowed vertebrates to move onto land. The skull, the
most anterior component of the main axis of the vertebrate
endoskeleton, encases the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#brain"><FONT SIZE="+1">brain</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
The high degree of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cephalization"><FONT SIZE="+1">cephalization</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
in vertebrates is accompanied by complex sense organs concentrated in
the head region. Eyes developed as outgrowths of the brain. Ears were
equilibrium devices in aquatic vertebrates that function as
sound-wave receivers in land vertebrates. Vertebrates have a complete
digestive system and a large coelom. Their circulatory system is
closed, with respiratory pigments contained within blood vessels. Gas
exchange is efficiently accomplished by gills, lungs, and in a few
cases, moist skin. Kidneys are efficient in excretion of nitrogenous
waste and regulation of water. Reproduction is usually sexual with
separate sexes. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Classification of the Vertebrata</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The first vertebrates were fishlike. Fishes are
aquatic, gill-breathing vertebrates that usually have fins and skin
covered with scales. The larval form of a modern-day lamprey, which
looks like a lancelet, may resemble the first vertebrates: it has the
three chordate characteristics (like the tunicate larva), as well as
a two-chambered heart, a three-part brain, and other internal organs
that are like those of vertebrates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Small, jawless, and finless ostracoderms were the
earliest vertebrates. They were filter feeders, but probably were
also able to move water through their gills by muscular action.
Ostracoderms have been found as fossils from the Cambrian through
Devonian periods, when the group finally went extinct. Although
extant jawless fishes lack protection, many early jawless fishes had
large defensive head shields.</FONT></P>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Class Petromyzontiformes, Lampreys</FONT></H5>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">These long, eel-like, jawless fish are
free-swimming predators on other fish. Lampreys hatch in freshwater
and many live their lives entirely in freshwater. Some lampreys
migrate to the sea, but must return to freshwater to reproduce.
Lampreys have a sucker-like mouth that lacks a jaw.</FONT></P>

fish are the most successful and diverse of the vertebrates (more

supports with radiating bones (hence the term ray-finned) hold the
fins away from the body. Ray-finned fish obtain their food by filter
feeding and by preying on insects and other animals. Their skin is
covered by scales formed of bone. These scales are homologous to our
own hair (and the feathers of birds), being derived from the same
embryonic tissues. The gills in this group of fish do not open
separately and are covered by an operculum. Ray-finned fish have a
swim bladder, a gas-filled sac, that regulates buoyancy and depth.

sinking. The swim bladder acts much the way a ballast tank does on a

into aquatic larvae with gills (tadpoles). Aquatic larvae usually

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Evolutionary History of Reptiles</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Reptiles first evolved during the Carboniferous
time and partly displaced amphibians in many environments. The first
reptiles (often referred to as the stem reptiles) gave rise to
several other lineages, each of which adapted to a different way of
life. Reptilian success was due to their terrestrial (amniotic) egg
and internal fertilization, as well as their tough leathery skin,
more efficient teeth and jaws, and in some, bipedalism (traveling on
their hind legs, allowing the forelimbs to grasp prey or food, or
become wings). One group, the Pelycosaurs (fin-backed or sail
lizards) are related to therapsids, mammal-like reptiles ancestral to
mammals. Other groups returned to aquatic environments. Ichthyosaurs
were fishlike (or dolphin-like) free-swimming predators of the
Mesozoic seas. The plesiosaurs had a long neck and a body adapted tp
swimming though use of flippers (legs that evolutionarily reverted to
a flipper-like shape). These free-swimmers also adapted to live birth
of their young (since they could not return to the land to lay eggs).
Thecodonts were the reptiles that gave rise to most of the reptiles,
living and extinct. Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that dominated
the Mesozoic skies. They had a keel for attachment of flight muscles
and air spaces in bones to reduce weight. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Dinosaurs (descended from some thecodonts) and
mammal-like reptiles' had their limbs beneath the body providing
increased agility and facilitating gigantic size. Lizards have their
elbows out (like you do when you do a push-up). By having their
elbows in, dinosaurs and mammals place more of the weight of the body
on the long bones instead of the elbows, ankles, and knees.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Reptiles dominated the earth for about 170 million
years during the Mesozoic Era. The mass extinction of many reptile
groups at the close of the Mesozoic (the Cretaceous Period) has been
well documented and the subject of many hypotheses. The 1980
hypothesis by Luis and Walter Alvarez and others proposes the impact
of a large meteorite at the end of the Cretaceous period caused a
catastrophic environmental collapse that led to the extinction of
nearly 50% of all species of life on Earth. The survivors, birds and
mammals, reaped the spoils and diversified during the Cenozoic Era.
Three groups of reptiles remain: turtles, snakes/lizards, and
crocodiles/alligators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">About 6,000 species of reptiles comprise the Class
Reptilia. Most live in tropics or subtropics. Lizards and snakes live
on land, while turtles and alligators live in water for much of their
lives. Reptiles have a thick, scaly skin that is keratinized and
impermeable to water. This same keratin is a protein found in hair,
fingernails, and feathers. Protective skin prevents water loss but
requires several molts a year. Reptilian lungs are more developed
than those of amphibians. Air moves in and out of the lungs due to
the presence of an expandable rib cage in all reptiles except
turtles. Most reptiles have a nearly four-chambered heart. The
crocodile has a completely four-chambered heart that more fully
separates oxygen-rich blood from from deoxygenated or oxygen-poor
blood. The well-developed kidneys excrete uric acid; less water is
lost in excretion. Reptiles are ectothermic; they require a fraction
of the food per body weight of birds and mammals, but are
behaviorally adapted to warm their body temperature by sunbathing.

lizards live underground. Snakes evolved from lizards and lost their
legs as an adaptation to burrowing. Their jaws can readily dislocate

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Cladistic analyses place the birds, alligators,
and dinosaurs in the same clade, the Archosauria (or "ruling
reptiles"). This group is a major group of diapsids (vertebrates that
have two openings in their skulls) that have single openings in each
side of the skull, in front of the eyes (antorbital fenestrae), among
other characteristics. This helps to lighten the skull, provides more
room for muscles and other tissues, and allows more skull flexibility
when eating. Other typical archosaurian characteristics include
another opening in the lower jaw (the mandibular fenestra), a high
narrow skull with a pointed snout, teeth set in sockets, and a
modified ankle joint. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The ancestral archosaurs probably originated some
250 million years or so ago, during the late Permian period. Their

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Remember, not all animals that fly have feathers,
but all almost every endothermic animal (warm-blooded) has a covering
of hair or feathers for insulation. The recent (1999) discovery of a
"feathered" dinosaur adds credence to this speculation. The dinosaur
could not fly, so of what use would feather be but insulation (or
possibly mating).</FONT></P>

Monotremes are today restricted to Australia and New Guinea. The
earliest fossil monotreme is from the early Cretaceous, and younger
fossils hint at a formerly more widespread distribution for the
group. While their </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossF.html#fossil record"><FONT SIZE="+1">fossil
record</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is scarce, zoologists believe that
monotremes probably diverged from other mammals during the Mesozoic.
Monotremes have many differences with other mammals and are often
placed in a separate group, the subclass Prototheria. They retain
many characters of their therapsid ancestors, such as laying eggs,
limbs oriented with humerus and femur held lateral to body (more
lizard-like), a cloaca, skulls with an almost birdlike appearance,
and a lack of teeth in adults. This suggests that monotremes are the
sister group to all other mammals. However, monotremes do have all of
the mammalian defining features of the group.</FONT></P>

today are dominant only in Australia, where they underwent adaptive
radiation in the absence of placental mammals. The Metatheria
contains 272 species classified in several orders. Metatheres
diverged from the lineage leading to the eutherian (placental)
mammals by the middle of the Cretaceous period in North America. The
earliest marsupial fossils resemble North American opossums.
