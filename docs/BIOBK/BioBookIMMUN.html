<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#lymphatic system"><FONT SIZE="+1">lymphatic
system</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> is composed of lymph vessels, lymph
nodes, and organs. The functions of this system include the
absorbtion of excess fluid and its return to the blood stream,
absorption of fat (in the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossV.html#villi"><FONT SIZE="+1">villi</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">

function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Lymph vessels are closely associated with the
circulatory system vessels. Larger lymph vessels are similar to
veins. Lymph capillaries are scatted throughout the body. Contraction
of skeletal muscle causes movement of the lymph fluid through
valves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Lymph organs include the bone marrow, lymph nodes,
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossS.html#spleen"><FONT SIZE="+1">spleen</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
and thymus. Bone marrow contains tissue that produces
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#lymphocytes"><FONT SIZE="+1">lymphocytes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
B-lymphocytes (B-cells) mature in the bone marrow. T-lymphocytes
(T-cells) mature in the thymus gland. Other blood cells such as

and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossL.html#leukocytes"><FONT SIZE="+1">leukocytes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
are produced in the bone marrow. Lymph nodes are areas of
concentrated lymphocytes and </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#macrophages"><FONT SIZE="+1">macrophages</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
along the lymphatic veins. The spleen is similar to the lymph node
except that it is larger and filled with blood. The spleen serves as
a reservoir for blood, and filters or purifies the blood and lymph
fluid that flows through it. If the spleen is damaged or removed, the
individual is more susceptible to infections. The thymus secretes a
hormone, thymosin, that causes pre-T-cells to mature (in the thymus)
into T-cells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Immunity is the body's capability to repel foreign
substances and cells. The nonspecific responses are the first line of
defense. Highly specific responses are the second line of defense and
are tailored to an individual threat. The immune response includes
both specific and nonspecific components. Nonspecific responses block
the entry and spread of disease-causing agents. Antibody-mediated and
cell-mediated responses are two types of specific response. The
immune system is associated with defense against disease-causing
agents, problems in transplants and blood transfusions, and diseases
resulting from over-reaction (autoimmune, allergies) and
under-reaction (AIDS). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Barriers to entry are the skin and mucous
membranes. The skin is a passive barrier to infectious agents such as
bacteria and viruses. The organisms living on the skin surface are
unable to penetrate the layers of dead skin at the surface. Tears and
saliva secrete enzymes that breakdown bacterial cell walls. Skin
glands secrete chemicals that retard the growth of bacteria. Mucus
membranes lining the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and
reproductive tracts secrete mucus that forms another barrier.
Physical barriers are the first line of defense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When microorganisms penetrate skin or epithelium
lining respiratory, digestive, or urinary tracts, </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossI.html#inflammation"><FONT SIZE="+1">inflammation</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
results. Damaged cells release chemical signals such as
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#histamine"><FONT SIZE="+1">histamine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
that increase capillary blood flow into the affected area (causing
the areas to become heated and reddened). The heat makes the
environment unfavorable for microbes, promotes healing, raises
mobility of white blood cells, and increases the metabolic rate of
nearby cells. Capillaries pass fluid into </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossI.html#interstitial"><FONT SIZE="+1">interstitial</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
areas, causing the infected/injured area to swell. Clotting factors
trigger formation of many small blood clots. Finally, monocytes (a
type of white blood cell) clean up dead microbes, cells, and
debris.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The inflammatory response is often strong enough
to stop the spread of disease-causing agents such as viruses,
bacteria, and fungi. The response begins with the release of chemical
signals and ends with cleanup by monocytes. If this is not enough to
stop the invaders, the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#complement system"><FONT SIZE="+1">complement

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The complement system directly kills microbes,
supplements inflammatory response, and works with the immune
response. It complements the actions of the immune system. Complement

defense. Lymphocytes, monocytes, lymph organs, and lymph vessels make
up the system. The immune system is able to distinguish self from
non-self. Antigens are chemicals on the surface of a cell. All cells
have these. The immune system checks cells and identifies them as
"self" or "non-self". Antibodies are proteins produced by certain
lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen. B-lymphocytes and
T-lymphocytes produce the antibodies. B-lymphocytes become plasma
cells which then generate antibodies. T-lymphocytes attack cells
which bear antigens they recognize. They also mediate the immune
response.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The immune system can develop long-term immunity
to some diseases. Man can use this to develop vaccines, which produce
induced immunity. Active immunity develops after an illness or
vaccine. Vaccines are weakened (or killed) viruses or bacteria that
prompt the development of antibodies. Application of biotechnology
allows development of vaccines that are the protein (antigen) which
in no way can cause the disease. Passive immunity is the type of
immunity when the individual is given antibodies to combat a specific
disease. Passive immunity is short-lived.</FONT></P>

Types, Rh, and Antibodies</FONT> | <A HREF="#Table of Contents"><B>Back

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There are 30 or more known antigens on the surface
of blood cells. These form the blood groups or blood types. In a
transfusion, the blood groups of the recipient and donor must be
matched. If improperly matched, the recipient's immune system will
produce antibodies causing clotting of the transfused cells, blocking
circulation through capillaries and producing serious or even fatal
results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">ABO blood types are determined by a gene, I (for
isoagglutinin). There are three alleles, I<SUP>A</SUP>, I<SUP>B</SUP>
and I<SUP>O</SUP>. Proteins produced by the A and B alleles are
antigenic. Individuals with blood type A have the A antigen on the
surface of their red blood cells, and antibodies to type B blood in
their plasma. People with blood type B have the B antigen on their
blood cells and antibodies against type A in their plasma.
Individuals with type AB blood produce have antigens for A and B on
their cell surfaces and no antibodies for either blood type A or B in
their plasma. Type O individuals have no antigens on their red blood
cells but antigens to both A and B are in their plasma.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">People with type AB blood can receive blood of any
type. Those with type O blood can donate to anyone. If a transfusion
is made between an incompatible donor and recipient, the recipient's
blood will undergo a cascade of events. Reaction of antigens on cells
and antibodies in plasma will produce clumping that clogs
capillaries, other cells burst, releasing hemoglobin that can
crystallize in the kidney and lead to kidney failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Rh (for the rhesus monkey in which it was
discovered) blood group is made up of those Rh positive
(Rh<SUP>+</SUP>) individuals who can make the Rh antigen and those Rh
negative (Rh<SUP>-</SUP>) who cannot. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) results
from Rh incompatibility between an Rh<SUP>-</SUP> mother and
Rh<SUP>+</SUP> fetus. Rh<SUP>+</SUP> blood from the fetus enters the
mother's system during birth, causing her to produce Rh antibodies.
The first child is usually not affected, however subsequent
Rh<SUP>+</SUP> fetuses will cause a massive secondary reaction of the
maternal immune system. To prevent HDN, Rh- mothers are given an Rh
antibody during the first pregnancy with an Rh+ fetus and all
subsequent Rh+ fetuses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Success of organ transplants and skin grafts
requires a matching of histocompatibility antigens that occur on all
cells in the body. Chromosome 6 contains a cluster of genes known as
the human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) that are critical to the
outcome of such procedures. The array of HLA alleles on either copy
of our chromosome 6 is known as a haplotype.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The large number of alleles involved mean no two
individuals, even in a family, will have the same identical
haplotype. Identical twins have a 100% HLA match. The best matches
are going to occur within a family. The preference order for
transplants is identical twin &gt; sibling &gt; parent &gt; unrelated
donor. Chances of an unrelated donor matching the recipient range
between 1 in 100,000-200,000. Matches across racial or ethnic lines
are often more difficult. When HLA types are matched survival of
transplanted organs dramatically increases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When the infected T cell is needed in the immune
response, the viral genes are activated and the virus replicates,
killing the infected cell and producing a new round on T4 cell
infection. Gradually the number of T4 cells, the master on switch for
the immune system, decline. The immune response grows less powerful,
eventually failing. Premature death results from a series of rare
diseases (such as fungal pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare
cancer) that overwhelm the body and its compromised immune
system.</FONT></P>
