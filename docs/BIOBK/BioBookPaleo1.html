<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Ask a child what interests them about biology and
you will not find (in most cases anyway) a child interested in DNA
and molecular biology, but rather a child wanting to know about
dinosaurs, wooly mammoths, and creatures more at home in J.R.R.
Tolkien's <U>The Lord of the Rings</U> than seen walking about the
modern world. We retain this thirst for the creatures of the past, as
evidenced by the mass popularity of the <U>Jurassic Park</U> books
and movies, popular books by a number of paleobiologists, and
numerous television programs, such as <U>Walking With Dinosaurs</U>.
Some of us have managed to keep this intereswt and enthusiasm for the
life of the past. We are paleobiologists, a term that literally means
"old studiers of life", although I prefer "study of ancient life" as
I myself become more ancient!</FONT></P>

are any evidence of past life. This is a very broad definition that
includes the standard shells, bones, petrified wood, and leaves.
However, there are many more things that can become fossils:
footprints, pollen, feeding traces, worm burrows, even fossilzed
feces. Scientists have begun to study fossil DNA mand other
biochemicals. Fossils can range from miniscule bacteria to behemoth
dinosaurs that would shake the ground as they walked. Aside from the
beauty of their patterns and textures, fossils tell us about what the
life of the past looked like, and in some cases, how it lived and
behaved. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The ancient Greeks thought fossils were the
remains of once-living creatures. During the Middle Ages fossils were
viewed as artifacts the Devil put there to tempt people's faith. The
seventeenth century work of Leonardo Da Vinci and Nicholas Steno
(among others) finally led to the widespread recognition of fossils
as the remains of creatures, many of which had no living similar
forms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We divide fossils into </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#body fossil"><FONT SIZE="+1">body

body fossil is a part of (or in some cases the entire) body of the
creature. In some rare cases the organic material of the creature
remains in the fossil, but more often we get casts and molds that
reveal the external and internal structure of the organism, but not
original material. Trace fossils do not reveal much information about
the anatomy of the creatures that made them, but instead offer
glimpses of the activity and physiology of the creature. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Time sets geology (and in many ways biology) apart
from other sciences. While particle physicists discuss the decay of
subatomic particles in miniscule fractions of a second,
paleobiologists are discussing spans of time longer than recorded
human history. Two types of geologic timeare relative time and
absolute time. Relative time ioncvolves the placing of events into a
sequence based on their relative positions in the geologic (or rock)
record. Absolute time is the placing of a specific number of years
(plus or minus a certain amount based on the accuracy od the
equipment used in this analysis) on an event or rock sample. This
ability was not developed until the early part of the 20th century.
Most of the building of ourt framework of geologic time sprang from
the application of relative dating techniques. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Archbishop James Ussher of Ireland, in the late
1600's, calculated the age of the earth based on the geneologies from
Adam and Eve listed in the biblical book of Genesis. According to
Ussher's calculations, the Earth formed on October 22, 4004 B.C.
These calculations were part of Ussher's book, <U>History of the
World</U>. The chronology he developed was taken as factual, and was
even printed in the front pages of bibles. Ussher's ideas were
readily accepted, in part because they posed no threat to the social
order of the times; comfortable ideas that would not upset the linked
applecarts of church and state.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/steno.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Niels
Stensen</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (1638-1686), more widely known by
his Latinized name of Nicholas Steno, made a series of observations
about the nature of fossils and the rocks that contained them. Steno,
along with his contemporaries John Ray and Robert Hooke, recognized
"tongue stones" as the teeth from ancient sharks. Steno's Principle
of Superposition states that in undisturbed strata the layer on the
bottom is oldest. This is one of the founding principles of modern
geology. Another of Steno's observations was that sedimentary
particles tended to settle out of water as thin sheets or horizontal
layers. Steno noted that sediment layers extended laterally in all
direction until they thinned, pinched out or met the edge of the
depositional basin.</FONT></P>

Hutton</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> 1726-1797, a Scottish physician,

the basis of modern geology and paleontology. According to Hutton's
work, certain geological processes operated in the past in much the
same fashion as they do today, with minor exceptions of rates, etc.
Thus many geological structures and processes cannot be explained if
the earth is only 5000 years old.</FONT></P>

concluded that fossil assemblages succeed one another through time.

evolution (change in life over time).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The 18th century French scientist Georges Louis de
Buffon cooled iron balls he thought simulated the Earth, arriving at
an age of at least 75,000 years. This date was well beyond Ussher's

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1897, the prominent British physicist Lord
Kelvin (given name William Thompson), attempted to experimentally
determine the age of the Earth. Kelvin assumed that the Earth was
originally molten and calculated a date of its formation based on
cooling through conduction and radiation. He calculated the age of
Earth as about 24-40 million years. This was wrong since his cooling
experiment did not account for the internal heat generated by
radioactive decay, unknown iwhen he did his calculations. </FONT></P>

also worked out the concept of </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossH.html#half-life"><FONT SIZE="+1">half-life</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Radioactive decay is the process where unstable
nuclei are spontaneously transformed into another element. A
half-life is the amount of time needed for one-half of a
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#radioisotope"><FONT SIZE="+1">radioisotope</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
to decay into its stable end (or daughter) product. By measuring the
various isotopes in a sample, geologists can calculate the age of the
specimen. Long-lived radioactive isotope pairs have half-lives in
millions or billions of years. The U-Pb series isotopes are used to
date ancient igneous intrusive rocks such as granite. Likewise, Rb-Sr
isotope ratios can be applied to ancient rocks and meteorites.
Fine-grained volcanic rocks, such as bentonite and basalt, are dated
by the ratios of K-Ar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There are several types of radioactive decay that
are used in geology. Alpha radiation (sometimes known as an alpha
particle) releases two protons and two neutrons (the alpha particle).
This large, slow-moving particle is similar to the nucleus of a
helium atom. Beta decay releases a fast-moving electron from a
neutron in the nucleus. Electron capture occurs when a proton has
captured an electron and becomes a neutron. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The U-238 decay series illustrates the complexity
of this concept. U-238 emits an alpha particle, becoming changed to
thorium-234, which in turn emits a beta particle. The thorium is
changed into protactinium-234, which later emits a beta particle,
causing it to become uranium-234. Emission of an alpha particle from
the U-234 forms thorium-230, which later on emits an alpha particle
to become radium-226, which in turn emits an alpha particle to form
radon-222, a gas. Radon-222 emits an alpha particle and becomes
polonium-218, wich become lead-214 with the later emission of an
alpha particle. Lead-214 emits a beta particle, becomming
bismuth-214, which later on emits a beta particle to form
polonium-214. The emission of an alpha particle converts polonium-214
into lead-210, this later emits a beta particle and becomes
bismuth-210, which in its turn emits a beta particle to form
polonium-210. The process stops when an alpha is emitted to form
lead-206, which is stable. Whew! If we start with one pound of U-238,
one half of the material will convert tp lead-206 in a mere 4.5
billion years!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The isotope pairs mentioned above allow us to date
only the rock surrounding the fossil., not the fossil itself.

Frank Libby</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (1908-1980), is based on the
ratio of C-14 to C-12 in an organic sample. This technique allows us
to date the fossil itself. However, the technique is valid only for
samples less than 70,000 years old. Living things take in both
isotopes of carbon (carbon-12 and carbon-14). Carbon-14 is
radioactive, and decays into nitrogen-14. As long as the organism was
alive, the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 was in equilibrium with
its environment. When the organism dies, the "clock" starts as the
carbon-14 decays, changing the ratio. The longer the time since
death, the more the isotopic ratio will have changed. . </FONT></P>

time units known as epochs, most commonly in the more recent parts of
geologic time. Most geologists recognize three eons: the Archean, the
Proterozoic, and the Phanerozoic. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Archean Eon encompasses the time from the
formation of the earth until 2.5 billion years ago. The rocks formed
during this eon are the most ancient rocks known, up to 3.96 billion
years old. The nature of this rock inducates that there were/are even
older rocks that, if they still exist, have yet to be located and
dated. Perhaps the biggest development during the Archean was the
first appearance of life. The earliest forms of life were simple
prokaryotic cells, in a few cases remarkably similar to living
prokaryotic forms (at least in terms of observable cell structure and
size). Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on earth earlier
than 3.5 billion years ago. Specimens from the North Pole region of
Western Australia are of such diversity and apparent complexity that
even more primitive cells must have existed earlier. Rocks of the
Ishua Super Group in Greenland yield possibly the fossil remains of
the earliest cells, 3.8 billion years old. Life appears to have begun
soon after the cooling of the Earth and formation of its atmosphere
and oceans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Proterozoic Eon covers the time span from 2.5
billion to 544 million years ago. Simple, prokaryotic cells still
dominated the world's environments until the evolution of simple
eukaryotes approximately 1.5-1.2 billion years ago. With the
appearance of eukaryotes comes the development of sexual
reproduction, which greatly increased the variation that natural
selection could operate on. A major enbvironmental change, initiated
by living things, was the development of oxygenic photosynthesis.
This led to increasing oxygen levels during later Proterozoic.
Geologists refer to the "great iron crisis" when the rising levels of
oxygen in the world's oceans caused the formation or iron oxide
(Fe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), often preserved as the banded iron
formation (an important commercial source of iron). </FONT></P>
