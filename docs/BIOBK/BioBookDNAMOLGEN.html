<P><FONT SIZE="+1">While the period from the early 1900s to World War
II has been considered the "golden age" of genetics, scientists still
had not determined that DNA, and not protein, was the hereditary
material. However, during this time a great many genetic discoveries
were made and the link between genetics and evolution was
made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Friedrich Meischer in 1869 isolated DNA from fish
sperm and the pus of open wounds. Since it came from nuclei, Meischer
named this new chemical, nuclein. Subsequently the name was changed
to </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#nucleic acids"><FONT SIZE="+1">nucleic
acid</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> and lastly to </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)"><FONT SIZE="+1">deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA)</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">. Robert Feulgen, in 1914,
discovered that fuchsin dye stained DNA. DNA was then found in the

cells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the 1920s, biochemist P.A. Levene analyzed
the components of the DNA molecule. He found it contained four
nitrogenous bases: </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#cytosine"><FONT SIZE="+1">cytosine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,

</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#deoxyribose"><FONT SIZE="+1">deoxyribose
sugar</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">; and a phosphate group. He concluded
that the basic unit (</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossN.html#nucleotides"><FONT SIZE="+1">nucleotide</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">)
was composed of a base attached to a sugar and that the phosphate
also attached to the sugar. He (unfortunately) also erroneously
concluded that the proportions of bases were equal and that there was
a tetranucleotide that was the repeating structure of the molecule.
The nucleotide, however, remains as the fundemantal unit (monomer) of
the nucleic acid polymer. There are four nucleotides: those with
cytosine (C), those with guanine (G), those with adenine (A), and
those with thymine (T). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the early 1900s, the study of genetics
began in earnest: the link between Mendel's work and that of cell
biologists resulted in the chromosomal theory of inheritance; Garrod
proposed the link between genes and "inborn errors of metabolism";
and the question was formed: what is a gene? The answer came from the
study of a deadly infectious disease: pneumonia. During the 1920s
Frederick Griffith studied the difference between a disease-causing
strain of the pneumonia causing bacteria (<I>Streptococcus
peumoniae</I>) and a strain that did not cause pneumonia. The
pneumonia-causing strain (the S strain) was surrounded by a capsule.
The other strain (the R strain) did not have a capsule and also did
not cause pneumonia. Frederick Griffith (1928) was able to induce a
nonpathogenic strain of the bacterium <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>
to become pathogenic. Griffith referred to a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossT.html#transforming factor"><FONT SIZE="+1">transforming
facto</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">r that caused the non-pathogenic
bacteria to become pathogenic. Griffith injected the different
strains of bacteria into mice. The S strain killed the mice; the R
strain did not. He further noted that if heat killed S strain was
injected into a mouse, it did not cause pneumonia. When he combined
heat-killed S with Live R and injected the mixture into a mouse
(remember neither alone will kill the mouse) that the mouse developed
pneumonia and died. Bacteria recovered from the mouse had a capsule
and killed other mice when injected into them!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hypotheses: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. The dead S strain had been
reanimated/resurrected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. The Live R had been transformed into Live S by
some "transforming factor".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Further experiments led Griffith to conclude that
number 2 was correct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1944, Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn
McCarty revisited Griffith's experiment and concluded the
transforming factor was DNA. Their evidence was strong but not
totally conclusive. The then-current favorite for the hereditary
material was protein; DNA was not considered by many scientists to be
a strong candidate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The breakthrough in the quest to determine the
hereditary material came from the work of Max Delbruck and Salvador
Luria in the 1940s. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#bacteriophages"><FONT SIZE="+1">Bacteriophage</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
are a type of virus that attacks bacteria, the viruses that Delbruck
and Luria worked with were those attacking <I>Escherichia coli</I>, a
bacterium found in human intestines. Bacteriophages consist of
protein coats covering DNA. Bacteriophages infect a cell by injecting
DNA into the host cell. This viral DNA then "disappears" while taking
over the bacterial machinery and beginning to make new virus instead
of new bacteria. After 25 minutes the host cell bursts, releasing
hundreds of new bacteriophage. Phages have DNA and protein, making
them ideal to resolve the nature of the hereditary
material.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In 1952, </FONT><A HREF="http://www.gene.com/ae/AB/GG/hershey.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Alfred
D. Hershey and Martha Chase</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (click the
link to view details of their experiment) conducted a series of
experiments to determine whether protein or DNA was the hereditary
material. By labeling the DNA and protein with different (and
mutually exclusive) radioisotopes, they would be able to determine
which chemical (DNA or protein) was getting into the bacteria. Such
material must be the hereditary material (Griffith's transforming
agent). Since DNA contains Phosphorous (P) but no Sulfur (S), they
tagged the DNA with radioactive Phosphorous-32. Conversely, protein
lacks P but does have S, thus it could be tagged with radioactive
Sulfur-35. Hershey and Chase found that the radioactive S remained
outside the cell while the radioactive P was found inside the cell,
indicating that DNA was the physical carrier of heredity. </FONT></P>

many different forms of life, concluding that the amount of

(as proposed by Levene). DNA had been proven as the genetic material
by the Hershey-Chase experiments, but how DNA served as genes was not
yet certain. DNA must carry information from parent cell to daughter
cell. It must contain information for replicating itself. It must be
chemically stable, relatively unchanging. However, it must be capable
of mutational change. Without mutations there would be no process of
evolution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many scientists were interested in deciphering the
structure of DNA, among them were Francis Crick, James Watson,
Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkens. Watson and Crick gathered all
available data in an attempt to develop a model of DNA structure.
Franklin took </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossWXYZ.html#x-ray diffraction"><FONT SIZE="+1">X-ray

crystalline DNA extract, the key to the puzzle. The data known at the
time was that DNA was a long molecule, proteins were helically coiled
(as determined by the work of Linus Pauling), Chargaff's base data,
and the x-ray diffraction data of Franklin and Wilkens. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Meselson-Stahl experiment involved the growth
of <I>E. coli</I> bacteria on a growth medium containing heavy
nitrogen (Nitrogen-15 as opposed to the more common, but lighter
molecular weight isotope, Nitrogen-14). The first generation of
bacteria was grown on a medium where the sole source of N was
Nitrogen-15. The bacteria were then transferred to a medium with
light (Nitrogen-14) medium. Watson and Crick had predicted that DNA
replication was semi-conservative. If it was, then the DNA produced
by bacteria grown on light medium would be intermediate between heavy
and light. It was.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">DNA replication involves a great many building

cycle</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> cells have a G phase to regenerate
energy for cell division). Only occurring in a cell once per (cell)
generation, DNA replication in humans occurs at a rate of 50
nucleotides per second, 500/second in prokaryotes. Nucleotides have
to be assembled and available in the nucleus, along with energy to
make bonds between nucleotides. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#DNA polymerase"><FONT SIZE="+1">DNA
polymerases</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> unzip the helix by breaking
the H-bonds between bases. Once the polymerases have opened the
molecule, an area known as the replication bubble forms (always
initiated at a certain set of nucleotides, the origin of
replication). New nucleotides are placed in the fork and link to the
corresponding parental nucleotide already there (A with T, C with G).
Prokaryotes open a single replication bubble, while eukaryotes have
multiple bubbles. The entire length of the DNA molecule is replicated
as the bubbles meet.</FONT></P>
