<P><FONT SIZE="+1">For much of human history people were unaware of
the scientific details of how babies were conceived and how heredity
worked. Clearly they were conceived, and clearly there was some
hereditary connection between parents and children, but the
mechanisms were not readily apparent. The Greek philosophers had a
variety of ideas: Theophrastus proposed that male flowers caused
female flowers to ripen; Hippocrates speculated that "seeds" were
produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the
time of conception, and Aristotle thought that male and female semen
mixed at conception. Aeschylus, in 458 BC, proposed the male as the
parent, with the female as a "nurse for the young life sown within
her".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the 1700s, Dutch microscopist
</FONT><A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/leeuwenhoek.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Anton
van Leeuwenhoek</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> (1632-1723) discovered
"animalcules" in the </FONT><A HREF="#sperm"><FONT SIZE="+1">sperm</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
of humans and other animals. Some scientists speculated they saw a
"little man" (homunculus) inside each sperm. These scientists formed
a school of thought known as the "spermists". They contended the only
contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in
which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb. An
opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future
human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of
the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl
children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well
before conception. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Pangenesis was an idea that males and females
formed "pangenes" in every organ. These pangenes subsequently moved
through their blood to the genitals and then to the children. The
concept originated with the ancient Greeks and influenced biology
until little over 100 years ago. The terms "blood relative",
"full-blooded", and "royal blood" are relicts of pangenesis. Francis
Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, experimentally tested and disproved
pangenesis during the 1870s. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Blending theories of inheritance supplanted the
spermists and ovists during the 19th century. The mixture of sperm
and egg resulted in progeny that were a "blend" of two parents'
characteristics. Sex cells are known collectively as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossG.html#gametes"><FONT SIZE="+1">gametes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
(<I>gamos</I>, Greek, meaning marriage). According to the blenders,
when a black furred animal mates with white furred animal, you would
expect all resulting progeny would be gray (a color intermediate
between black and white). This is often not the case. Blending
theories ignore characteristics skipping a generation. Charles Darwin
had to deal with the implications of blending in his theory of
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#evolution"><FONT SIZE="+1">evolution</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
He was forced to recognize blending as not important (or at least not
the major principle), and suggest that science of the mid-1800s had
not yet got the correct answer. That answer came from a contemporary,
Gregor Mendel, although Darwin apparently never knew of Mendel's
work. </FONT></P>

opening of the pea flower. The pollen grain grows a </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#pollen tube"><FONT SIZE="+1">pollen
tube</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> which allows the sperm to travel
through the stigma and style, eventually reaching the ovary. The
ripened ovary wall becomes the fruit (in this case the pea pod). Most
flowers allow cross-pollination, which can be difficult to deal with
in genetic studies if the male parent plant is not known. Since pea
plants are self-pollinators, the genetics of the parent can be more
easily understood. Peas are also self-compatible, allowing
self-fertilized embryos to develop as readily as out-fertilized
embryos. Mendel tested all 34 varieties of peas available to him
through seed dealers. The garden peas were planted and studied for
eight years. Each character studied had two distinct forms, such as
tall or short plant height, or smooth or wrinkled seeds. Mendel's
experiments used some 28,000 pea plants.</FONT></P>

resulting seeds were smooth. The following year, Mendel planted these

5474 smooth and 1850 wrinkled. To help with record keeping,
generations were labeled and numbered. The parental generation is
denoted as the P1 generation. The offspring of the P1 generation are
the F1 generation (first filial). The self-fertilizing F1 generation
produced the F2 generation (second filial).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mendel studied seven traits which appeared in two
discrete forms, rather than continuous characters which are often
difficult to distinguish. When "true-breeding" tall plants were
crossed with "true-breeding" short plants, all of the offspring were
tall plants. The parents in the cross were the P1 generation, and the
offspring represented the F1 generation. The trait referred to as
tall was considered </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#dominant"><FONT SIZE="+1">dominan</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">t,
while short was recessive. Dominant traits were defined by Mendel as
those which appeared in the F1 generation in crosses between
true-breeding strains. </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossR.html#recessive"><FONT SIZE="+1">Recessives</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
were those which "skipped" a generation, being expressed only when
the dominant trait is absent. Mendel's plants exhibited
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#complete dominance"><FONT SIZE="+1">complete
dominance</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, in which the phenotypic
expression of alleles was either dominant or recessive, not "in
between". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When members of the F1 generation were crossed,
Mendel recovered mostly tall offspring, with some short ones also
occurring. Upon statistically analyzing the F2 generation, Mendel
determined the ratio of tall to short plants was approximately 3:1.
Short plants have skipped the F1 generation, and show up in the F2
and succeeding generations. Mendel concluded that the traits under
study were governed by discrete (separable) factors. The factors were
inherited in pairs, with each generation having a pair of trait
factors. We now refer to these trait factors as </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#alleles"><FONT SIZE="+1">alleles</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Having traits inherited in pairs allows for the observed phenomena of
traits "skipping" generations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Methods, Results, and Conclusions</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mendel started with true-breeding plants that had
smooth, yellow seeds and crossed them with true-breeding plants
having green, wrinkled seeds. All seeds in the F1 had smooth yellow
seeds. The F2 plants self-fertilized, and produced four
phenotypes:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">315 smooth yellow</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">108 smooth green</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">101 wrinkled yellow</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">32 wrinkled green</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mendel analyzed each trait for separate
inheritance as if the other trait were not present.The 3:1 ratio was
seen separately and was in accordance with the Principle of
Segregation. The segregation of S and s alleles must have happened
independently of the segregation of Y and y alleles. The chance of
any gamete having a Y is 1/2; the chance of any one gamete having a S
is 1/2.The chance of a gamete having both Y and S is the product of
their individual chances (or 1/2 X 1/2 = 1/4). The chance of two
gametes forming any given genotype is 1/4 X 1/4 (remember, the
product of their individual chances). Thus, the Punnett Square has 16
boxes. Since there are more possible combinations to produce a smooth
yellow phenotype (SSYY, SsYy, SsYY, and SSYy), that phenotype is more
common in the F2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">From the results of the second experiment, Mendel
formulated the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#principle of independent assort"><FONT SIZE="+1">Principle
of Independent Assortment</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1"> -- that when
gametes are formed, alleles assort independently. If traits assort
independent of each other during gamete formation, the results of the
dihybrid cross can make sense. Since Mendel's time, scientists have
discovered chromosomes and DNA. We now interpret the Principle of
Independent Assortment as alleles of genes on different chromosomes
are inherited independently during the formation of gametes. This was
not known to Mendel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><A NAME="Punnett squares"></A>Punnett squares deal
only with probability of a genotype showing up in the next
generation. Usually if enough offspring are produced, Mendelian
ratios will also be produced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 1 - definition of alleles and determination
of dominance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 2 - determination of alleles present in all
different types of gametes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 3 - construction of the square.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 4 - recombination of alleles into each small
square.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 5 - Determination of Genotype and Phenotype
ratios in the next generation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Step 6 - Labeling of generations, for example P1,
F1, etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">While answering genetics problems, there are
certain forms and protocols that will make unintelligible problems
easier to do. The term "true-breeding strain" is a code word for
homozygous. Dominant alleles are those that show up in the next
generation in crosses between two different "true-breeding strains".
The key to any genetics problem is the recessive phenotype (more
properly the phenotype that represents the recessive genotype). It is
that organism whose genotype can be determined by examination of the
phenotype. Usually homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals
have identical phenotypes (although their genotypes are different).
This becomes even more important in dihybrid crosses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hugo de Vries, one of three turn-of-the-century
scientists who rediscovered the work of Mendel, recognized that
occasional abrupt, sudden changes occurred in the patterns of
inheritance in the primrose plant. These sudden changes he termed
</FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossM.html#mutation"><FONT SIZE="+1">mutations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
De Vries proposed that new alleles arose by mutations. Charles
Darwin, in his <B>Origin of Species</B>, was unable to describe how
heritable changes were passed on to subsequent generations, or how
new </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#adaptation"><FONT SIZE="+1">adaptations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
arose. Mutations provided answers to problems of the appearance of
novel adaptations. The patterns of Mendelian inheritance explained
the perseverance of rare traits in organisms, all of which increased
variation, as you recall that was a major facet of Darwin's
theory.</FONT></P>
