So much of the biology studied in introductory classes deals with the
accomplishments of a small group of people: white males. There are
several reasons for this, including the exclusion of women from
academe for many years. This has changed. Please visit the links
below and answer a short series of questions pertaining to the
significance of achievements by the following people:</P>

<H3>Mary Anning</H3>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/anning.html">Mary
Anning (1799-1847)</A> During her lifetime Mary Anning, an untrained
Englishwoman who supported her family by fossil collecting, made a
number of significant discoveries, including the first ichthyosaurs
and plesiosaurs. Despite her beimng hailed as "the greatest fossilist
ever", her life has been made the subject of several books and
articles, yet little of her life is really known. This website at the
Museum of Paleontology and the University of California at Berkeley
offers a short biography and listing of her contributions to the
early days of paleontology. (URL: <A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/anning.html">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/anning.html</A>)</P>

contemporary minority scientists on this list, and also among the
youngest. In 1997 President Clinton awarded her the prestigious
Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which
is the highest governmental honor bestowed on scientists early in
their research careers. Her research has dealt with P53, which is a
gene that assists in the suppression of tumor cells. In addition to
being an accomplished researcher she is recognized for her teaching
skills, an uncommon combination in modern academe. (URL: <A HREF="http://hyper1.hunter.cuny.edu/JGH/biographies/bargonetti.html">http://hyper1.hunter.cuny.edu/JGH/biographies/bargonetti.html</A>)</P>
