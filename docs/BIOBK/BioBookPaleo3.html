modernization of life. By the end of the Paleozoic, almost all major

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossC.html#Cambrian"><FONT SIZE="+1">Cambrian
period</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">, the first in the Paleozoic era,
spans the time between 544 and 505 million years ago. During what is
termed the Cambrian Explosion, living thiungs developed hard
structures. The presence of these structures greatly enhanced the
chance of an organism becoming a fossil. Prior to the Cambrian,
fossils were quite rare and inconspicuous since the organisms were
small. This scarcity of the precambrian fossil record is also a
consequence of the soft-bodied forms of life needing exceptionally
rare circumstances to form fossils. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The sudden appearance of relatively complex
fossils in the Cambrian was a troubling issue to Charles Darwin. His
ideas on evolution included descent with modification and the slow,
gradual development of more complex creatures from simpler ones. The
lack of a precambrian fossil record was compounded by the wild
diversity seen during the Cambrian. Darwin's dilemma would not be
solved until the 1960s when scientists got a better handle on the
actual diversity of the precambrian </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#biosphere"><FONT SIZE="+1">biosphere</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The early Cambrian was a wild time for animal
evolution. During a span of time perhaps as short as 5 million years
numerous body plans developed, including the three animal body plans
that exist today. All major animal phyla, save the Bryozoans, have
their first appearance during the Cambrian. One of the dominant
animal groups that appeared was the trilobites. These now-extinct
members of the Phylum Arthroopoda became the dominant animals in many
Cambrian marine environments. Another major change was the evolution
and spread of the </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#archaeocyathids"><FONT SIZE="+1">archaeocyathids</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">,
a group of sponges (Phylum Porifiera) that became extinct before the
end of the Cambrian. Cladistic analysis by J. Reitner in 1990
suggests archaeocyathids are properly placed in the Phylum Porifera
instead of having their own phylum. Before their extinction, however,
they were important reef-building organisms, along with some
calcareous algae. Some scientists speculate that archaeocyathids
existed symbiotically with cyanobacteria, much the was modern coral
do with zooxanthellae (symbiotic </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossD.html#dinoflagellates"><FONT SIZE="+1">dinoflagellates</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">).
Paleontologists recognize an amazing 120 taxonomic families of
archaeocyathids during the early Cambrian. From this great diversity
the group declined to extinction by the close of the Cambrian.

was discovered by geologist </FONT><A HREF="http://geoclio.st.usm.edu/walcott.html"><FONT SIZE="+1">Charles

horse's hoof and spotted an odd fossil by the trail. Walcott returned
the next field season (and four others) and excavated over 50,000
fossils, which he later formally named and described in scientific
publications. Modern studies suggest the presence of approximately
125 different genera from the Burgess Shale, amking it the most
complete and famous known Paleozoic assemblage. The organisms range
from the prokaryotic cyanobacteria to eukaryotic green and red algae,
to sponges, brachiopods, priapulids, annelids, and many different
arthropod groups, as well as echinoderms and possibly one of the
first chordates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The world supercontinent, Rodinia, that had

composed of the present-day contnents of India, Australia,
Antarctica, Africa, and South America. The lands that today form
Europe were scattered and fragmented, for the most part in the
southern hemisphere. The lack of landmass at either pole suggests
relatively mild temperatures and an absence of glaciation, at least
early in the Cambrian. Shallow seas flooded the edges of continents,
creating many broad environments for marine animals and other
organisms. </FONT></P>

<H3>The Cambrian Extinctions</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Cambrian period is marked by as many as four
mass extinctions. The first of these mass extinctions resulted in the
disappearance of the archaeocyathids and a major group of trilobites.
The later extinctions limited the diversity of conodonts,
brachiopods, and other triolobite groups. The Cambrian is bracketed
by large scale glaciation at the close of the Proterozoic and by a
similar occurrence early in the Ordovician. Development of
continental glaciers would have several consequences: cooling of the
planet and a drop in sea level. Both of these might have happened
quickly enough for a mass extinction to have resulted. </FONT></P>

that hinge. <I>Lingula</I> is an example of this type, with fossils
very similar to that genus being found in Cambrian rocks, and

<H3>The Ordovician World</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Ordovician was a time of flooding of the
continents with shallow seas. Organic reefs were abundant in middle
to tropical paleolatitudes. By the end of th Ordovician most of the
landmasses were close to or joined to Gondwana, which at bthat time
was centered around the south pole. The late Ordovician also saw the
spread of major glaciers in Gondwana, and the environmental
conseqwuences that accompany that spread: sea-level falling, changes
in oceanic circulation, cooling of the climate and restriction of the
tropical belts. North America at this time was still astride the
equator. </FONT></P>

<H3>The Ordovician Mass Extinction<FONT SIZE="+1"> </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The end of the Ordovicianperiod saw another mass
extinction, accounting for the second most severe loss of marine
species during the Phanerozoic. This mass extinction saw the loss of
one third of all brachiopod and bryozoans, and the loss of groups of
conodonts, trilobites, and graptolites. The falling sea-levels caused
by the growth of the continental glaciers caused much of the
reef-building fauna to become either locally or globally extinct.
Over one hundred families of marine invertebrates disappeared.
However, this loss paved the way for an </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossA.html#adaptive radiation"><FONT SIZE="+1">adaptive

the jawed fish appearing and spreading into freshwater. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Corals, which had appeared possibly as early as
the late Proterozoic, diversified into a number of groups during the
Silurian. Tabulate corals and rugose corals were major components of
the new, larger reefs built during the Silurian through Permian.
Rugose corals included the horn corals, while tabulate corals were
colonial. Both the rugose and tabulate corals went extinct at the
close of the Permian period. </FONT></P>

Echinodermata, had been present since the Ordovician (and possibly
the Cambrian). With the flooding of continents during the Silurian,
crinoids underwent an adaptive radiation and produced a number of
interesting forms. The croinoid fossil can consist of three body
parts, usually separated by sedimentological processes after the
organism died: the basal holdfast, stalk, and head. Crinoid stems
were so common in some areas of the U.S. midwest that native peoples
used them as a form of currency. Crinoids were significant elements
of the marine fauna until they nearly went extinct (down to a single
genus) at the close of the Permian period. </FONT></P>

Eurypterids were chelicerates, the group of arthropods that includes

the Silurian rocks of New York that they are the state fossil.

The great explosion of these fish groups would occur during the

themselves in both marine and freshwater environments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Perhaps the most significant advance of life
during the Silurian was the colonization of the land, first by plants
and insects, and later (during the devonian) by certain "fish" and
their offshoots, the amphibians. The Silurian land was populated by
early land plants as well as a variety of insects. Both plants and
animals had a number of challenges when they moved from the water to
land.</FONT></P>

   can occur. Organismal response to the challenge of drying out
   tends to make these surfaces thicker, waterproof, and to retard

   modified or developed. Many fish already had gills and swim
   bladders, so when some of them began moving between ponds, the
   swim bladder (a gas retention structure helping buoyancy in the
   fish) began to act as a gas exchange surface, ultimately evolving
   into the terrestrial lung. Many arthropods had gills or other
   internal respiratory surfaces that were modified to facilitate gas
   exchange on land. Plants are thought to share common ancestry with
   algae. The plant solution to gas exchange is a new structure, the

<H3>The Silurian World</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Silurian climates were characterized by a warming
and return to moderate temperatures following the terminal Ordovician
glaciation (and the resulting mass extinction). North America
remained near the equator, but began to join with Baltical to the
east and Siberia to the north. Gondwana remained as a large southern
hemisphere landmass, although there is no evidence of glaciation
there during the Silurian. The collision of Baltica and North America
caused mountain building (what geologists refer to as the Caledonian
orogeny) along with the closing of the ancient Iapetus ocean. Between
Baltica and Gondwana, however, a new ocean, Tethys, began to form.
The end of the Silurian is not marked by a major mass extinction
event. </FONT></P>
