 Viruses are obligate intracellular </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossPQ.html#parasites"><FONT SIZE="+1">parasites</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
that can be maintained only inside living cells. Whern we refer to
something as "obligate" that indicates that the virus (in this case)
must do or behave in the specified manner. Since viruses are obligate
intraellular parasites, the term conveys the idea that viruses must
carry out their reproduction by parasitizing a host cell. They cannot
multiply outside a living cell, they can only replicate inside of a
specific host. Animal viruses in laboratories are raised in live
chick embryos or propagated in cell tissue culture. Viruses infect
all sorts of cells, from bacteria to human cells, but for the most
part tend to be host specific. For example, the tobacco mosaic virus
infects certain plants; the rabies virus infects only mammals; and
the AIDS virus, HIV, infects only certain human blood cells. The
various viruses that cause hepatitis invade only liver tissues, while
the polio virus only reproduces in spinal nerve cells. Figure 5 shows
a bacterial virus, as well as an HIV human virus. </FONT></P>

for the virus to reproduce and exit from the host cell. The virus

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The lytic cycle is one in which the virus takes
over operation of the bacterium immediately upon entering it, with
the production of new viruses and their subsequent release destroying
the bacterium.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">The lysogenic cycle is seen
when the virus incorporates its DNA into that of the bacterium, with
some delay until the production of new viruses. Following attachment
and penetration, viral DNA becomes integrated into bacterial DNA with
no destruction of host DNA. When this occurs, the phage is latent,
and the viral DNA is called a prophage. This prophage is replicated
along with host DNA, so all subsequent cells produced by the infected
but latent cell (lysogenic cells) carry a copy of the prophage.
Certain environmental factors (for example, ultraviolet radiation)
induce the prophage to enter the biosynthesis stage of the lytic
cycle, followed by maturation and release.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Still other viruses invade animal cells and

bacteriophages do, although with modifications. If the virus has an
envelope, glycoprotein spikes first adhere to plasma membrane

taken into the host cell by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossE.html#endocytosis"><FONT SIZE="+1">endocytosis</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
Once inside the host cell, the virus loses its envelope and capsid.
The viral nucleic acid, now free of its covering, proceeds with
biosynthesis. Newly assembled viral particles are released not vial
cell lysis, but rather by </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossB.html#budding"><FONT SIZE="+1">budding</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">.
During this process, the viral particles pick up their envelopes on
host cell membrane. Components of viral envelopes are obtained from
the plasma membrane as the viruses leave the cell. Budding does not
necessarily result in the death of the host cell. This process is
shown in Figure 8. </FONT></P>

RNA sequence into a DNA strand.. Once the retroviral RNA and reverse
transcriptase are inside the host cell, as shown in Figure 9, the
enzyme reverses transcription by making a single stranded DNA from
the retroviral RNA. Viral DNA can be integrated into the host DNA. It
remains in the genome and is replicated whenever the host DNA
replicates. If viral DNA is transcribed, new viruses are produced by
biosynthesis, maturation, and release by budding. Retroviruses
include HIV and also cause certain forms of cancer.</FONT></P>

Diseases</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+1">| </FONT><A HREF="#Table of Contents"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Back

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Viruses cause a variety of diseases among all
groups of living things. Viral plant diseases can be controlled
solely by burning those plants that show symptoms of disease. Viral
diseases in humans are controlled by preventing transmission,
administering vaccines, and only recently by the administration of
antiviral drugs. Virally caused human diseases include the flu,
common cold, herpes, measles, chicken pox, small pox, and
encephalitis. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses.
Vaccination offers protection for uninfected individuals. Frequent
hand washing and condom use may help prevent transmission. Vaccines
are substances that stimulate an immune response <B>without</B>
causing the illness. Commonly used virus vaccines include polio,
measles, and mumps. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Antibiotics do not cure viral infections because
viruses use enzymes produced by the host cell, rather than produce
not their own. A few antiviral drugs are available that interfere
with viral replication without interfering with host metabolism in
cells free of the virus. Antivirals include acyclovir for herpes and
AZT for AIDS. Despite recent successes with antiviral drugs,
vaccination and the prevention of exposure remain the most effective
ways to deal with viral infections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Smallpox was effectively elimated as a scourge on
humanity by worldwide vaccination programs. In fact the chances of
getting smallpox from a bad vaccine were greater than that of ever
encountering the virus in nature. The last U.S. case of smallpox
occurred in 1949, with the world's last naturally occurring case was
from Somalia in 1977. For this reason, in 1972 routine U.S. smallpox
vaccinations were discontinued. However, recent (September 2001)
concerns about bioweapons and bioterrorism have led the U.S.
government to consider plans to vaccinate the population against
smallpox. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viral diseases that
can cause liver damage. Like any viral disease, the major treatment
efforts focus on treatment of symptoms, not removal of the viral
cause. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis A is usually a mild malady indicated by
a sudden fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort.
The virus causing Hepatitis A is primarilly transmitted by fecal
contamination, although contaminated food and water also can promote
transmission. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A rare disease in the United States, hepatitis B
is endemic in parts of Asia where hundreds of millions of individuals
are possibly infected. The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be transmitted
by blood and blood products as well as sexual contact. The blood
supply in developed countries has been screened for the virus that
causes this disease for many years, and transmission by blood
transfusion is rare. The risk of HBV infection is high among
promiscuous homosexual men although it is also transmitted
hetereosexually. Correct use of condoms is thought to reduce or
eliminate the risk of transmission. Effective vaccines are available
for the prevention of Hepatitis B infection. Some individuals with
chronic hepatitis B may develop cirrhosis of the liver. Individuals
with chronic hepatitis B are at an increased risk of developing
primary liver cancer. Although this type of cancer is relatively rare
in the United States, it is the leading cause of cancer death in the
world, primarily because the virus causing it is endemic in eastern
Asia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hepatitis C affects approximately 170 million
people worldwide and 4 million in the United States. The virus is
transmitted primarily by blood and blood products. Most infected
individuals have either received blood transfusions prior to 1990
(when screening of the blood supply for the Hepatitis C virus began)
or have used intravenous drugs. Sexual transmission can occur between
monogamous couples (rare) but infection is far more common in those
who are promiscuous. In rare cases, Hepatitis C causes acute disease
and even liver failure. About twenty percent of individuals with
Hepatitis C who develop cirrhosis of the liver will also develop
severe liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C is presently
the leading cause of the need for liver transplants in the United
States. Individuals with cirrhosis from Hepatitis C also bear
increased chances of developing primary liver cancer. All current
treatments for Hepatitis C employ of various preparations of the
potent antiviral interferon alpha. However, not all patients who have
the disease are good candidates for treatment, so infected
individuals are urged to regularly consult their physician.

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Vaccination</FONT></H4>

<P><A HREF="BioBookglossV.html#vaccination"><FONT SIZE="+1">Vaccination</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
is a term derived from the Latin <I>vacca </I> (cow, after the cowpox
material used by British physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) in the
first vaccination in 1796). A </FONT><A HREF="BioBookglossV.html#vaccine"><FONT SIZE="+1">vaccine</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1">
stimulates the antibody production and formation of memory cells
without causing of the disease. Vaccines are made from killed
pathogens or weakened strains that cause antibody production but not
the disease. Recombinant DNA techniques can now be used to develop
even safer vaccines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The immune system can develop long-term immunity
to some diseases. Man can use this to develop vaccines, which produce
induced immunity. Active immunity develops after an illness or
vaccine. Vaccines are weakened (or killed) viruses or bacteria that
prompt the development of antibodies. Application of biotechnology
allows development of vaccines that are the protein (antigen) which
in no way can cause the disease. Passive immunity is the type of
immunity when the individual is given antibodies to combat a specific
disease. Passive immunity is short-lived.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Viruses are usually quite specific as to their
hosts and even to the types of cells they infect in a multicellular
